Next Is Now is a linear continuation of Goldman’s oeuvre, threading dubby new wave with funky basslines a la Tom Tom Club and treating spoken-word visions and falsetto melodies like downtown nursery rhymes.**************Produced by Youth (Killing Joke, the Orb, Paul McCartney) in Goldman’s native London, it incorporates vestiges of ’80s post-punk akin to her 1981 cult classic “Launderette.” Opener “Russian Doll” shares that song’s sauntering reggae tempo, but the record piles on modern flourishes, like the layer cake of synths and embellishments on “Vertigo.” Fans of her work will detect the transition from lo-fi to hi-fi most keenly on songs like “Home,” where the tinny charm of 1981’s “Private Armies” goes glossy, bright chords underpinning electronic blips and a mirage of “A neon whale/Flashing on the wall/At the corner of Houston Street & Broadway.” But where Goldman’s 30-year-old single concerns itself with a laundromat dalliance, this track—like the others on the album—interrogates the day’s heaviest issues.**************But where her work in the ’80s (like “Why,” from 1981) treated post-punk synths to reggae flourishes—”Blessing on this day/We hope it will stay bright.” that song goes—weary electronic blips underpin these songs by emblematized living legend Joan Didion narrating personal tribulations but most saliently concerns modern grief itself**************282**************0.16842105263157892

Instead of an artist who dominated VH1 and frat houses in the early 2000s, what if he’d emerged during the classic rock era and found himself, decades later, as a late-career musician attempting to update his sound?**************“Pretend someone made a record in 1988 and shelved it,” he explained, “and it was just found this year.” It’s an intriguing concept until you realize that, even in his fantasies, John Mayer is making music doomed to be lost to time, sapped of inspiration and out of his element.**************“He’s got this great record out,” you say.

Blending chamber music with vaporwave, gathering together field recordings and sketch-like musical ideas—minimalist pulses, cinematic drones, streaks of synth and zither—Hunt’s work as Dialect has always had more in common with collage than musical composition.**************“It started as a way to find a home for a bunch of disparate recordings I had knocking around that felt like they didn’t fit anywhere else,” he told The Wire recently; he approached his debut album, 2015’s Advanced Myth, “by treating the material as if I was making a mix of other people’s music—different styles and approaches being collaged together with unexpected connections and big emphasis on the flow.” Flow is paramount on Under~Between; the album’s 11 tracks proceed as parts of one unbroken whole, with little to delineate them.**************The tracks on his 2015 debut album “It is the way that I find a home for them,” felt like they didn’t fit anywhere else; if he was to continue making collaged material other people started chattering around one unbroken whole.”**************270**************0.3165467625899281
The history of electronic music, particularly in the UK, has been one of fractures and splits, as ever more specific styles and subgenres spin off into their own orbits.**************Special Request (aka Leeds’ Paul Woolford) is one of the enlightened few moving the other way, with his diverse catalogue including everything from chart-house bangers (“Looking for Me,” with Diplo and Kareen Lomax) to pungent nu-jungle (Special Request’s 2019 album Zero Fucks).**************2019’s Lomax album from Paul Woolford (akaSpecial Request) is his way to chart everything with nu-house bangers (“Looking for Me,” including Diplo).**************207**************0.31884057971014496
Featuring 22 tracks in just under 80 minutes, it serves as a meditation on all the things Dunn was capable of but unable to pursue.**************Nearly every song is remarkable, and nearly any of them could have served as a breakthrough—say, “I Pity the Country,” or the humorous but hopeless satire of “School Days,” or the Moby-Dick epic “The Pacific.” “You know, I’m a good fisherman,” Dunn once said of his career-long desire to get his music out there, “but there are no fish.” Because of his flat, searing baritone and his ability to infuse basic folk melodies with mystic, allusive poetry, Dunn was often compared to Leonard Cohen.**************“I have no music out there and I know every song is good.” Over his nearly career-long course with Moby-Dick or any fisherman could get them,” said Leonard Cohen once—The searing folk melodies are often compared**************286**************0.2047244094488189

James is looser than Mobb Deep, less eager-to-please than the punchline-happy Clipse; he orbits the Griselda universe, but they need him more than he needs them.**************December’s Real Bad Boldy is a full-length tryst with Real Bad Man, who, per their Bandcamp, “is a crew from Los Angeles that makes clothing but also happens to have fire-ass beats.” The conceit isn’t unprecedented—Conway the Machine recorded an entire tape credited to a streetwear line in 2019—and while I can’t speak to their $60 t-shirts, Real Bad Boldy’s 10 tracks corroborate the latter claim.**************He’s a street general who also happens to have an inquisitiveness with beats that makes 2019 “Conway The Machine.” I can’t recall t**************297**************0.3
Then, with “Martyrr,” a brief blast of noise—electrical static, a broken air conditioner, who knows—gives way to the mournful singing of a Christian monk, who is himself displaced, in “Bitterness,” by the sad, sour tones of plucked strings looped against keening, minor-key melodies.**************At times like these, Yin-Wong’s use of texture, contrast, and flow gives her arrangements an unmistakably musical, even lyrical character, like a dark-ambient DJ set accompanied by the tin-roof rattling of a Foley artist.**************The artist’s musicality and lyrical flow gives even these simple arrangements an unmistakably expressive character like her dark-ambient sculptured environments**************271**************0.3666666666666667

In between, they made one pivotal album that mined the hookiest qualities of the former iteration while laying the groundwork for the latter.**************Stacked with eminently catchy songs from top to bottom that sound evergreen in ways that evaded so much pop music from the same era, Listen Like Thieves is a classic “verge album”—think Fleetwood Mac, Soundgarden’s Badmotorfinger, R.E.M.’s Green, or U2’s The Unforgettable Fire—a mid-career highlight where a fully formed, fully confident band finds its footing at the precipice of something much bigger and maybe just beyond their control.**************The band’s mid-career highlight is a classic from top to bottom and its songs just sound so much bigger in their fully formed “Falling Down Like Thieves Soundgarden R.E.M U2 Unforgettable Fire**************518**************0.2857142857142857

Four years later came “A Boy Named Sue,” a near-novelty written by Silverstein and delivered with thundering menace by Cash—a combination that gave the Man In Black his biggest hit and opened up Nashville for its songwriter.**************Silverstein found some kindred spirits in Nashville—he wrote Waylon Jennings’ 1970 hit “The Taker” with Kris Kristofferson and authored Loretta Lynn’s 1971 “One’s on the Way” on his own—but he discovered his muse in Bobby Bare, a towering progressive country singer who had been kicking around Nashville for over a decade.**************And in 1971 he wrote Kris Kristofferson, Waylon Jennings’ Bobby Bare’s Loretta Lynn”The Taker“The singer who had been kicked around on country row found some kindred spirits**************548**************0.32941176470588235
