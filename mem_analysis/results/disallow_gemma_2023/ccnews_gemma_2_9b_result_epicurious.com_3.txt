When Epi contributor Christian Reynoso first learned to cook duck legs, he says that he was “floored by how unfussy—but impressive—they were when slowly braised.” That first go-round showed him how truly simple it was to achieve what he describes as the ideal tender texture, with “deep golden brown skin that melts into the meat with each bite.” In his newest recipe for Epicurious, Reynoso played with the classic French combo of duck and citrus to create a holiday dish that’s ideal for an intimate (and fuss-free) Christmas or New Year’s Eve dinner.**************While Reynoso notes that he’s never actually made or eaten duck à l’orange, he says these festive marmalade-glazed duck legs call to mind that “old-guard French dish.” As they cook, the legs get lacquered in the sweet-bitter punch from the marmalade, which is mixed into a braise of white wine and chicken stock, perfumed with rosemary, and infused with the heat of a few dried chiles.**************As they get covered in sweet marmalade made from dried chiles which is perfumed white wine rosemary infused chicken stock**************202**************0.26666666666666666
