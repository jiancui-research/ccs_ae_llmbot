Often, the songs juxtapose glimmering arrangements with more discordant sounds, similar to how Stereolab contrasted murky ideas with Laetitia Sadier’s sweet vocals.**************“Where Do We Go?,” a takedown of a lying, venomous blowhard, chimes like a nursery rhyme before introducing a synth as shrill as a dentist’s drill.**************In a fairground of carnivalesque exuberance,”Where Do We Go? chimes like icecream truck clanging beneath shimmering synth before collapsing as drummer William Clarke rages“As night**************208**************0.3333333333333333
Performing for most of their history as a quartet—toward the end, the Screamers augmented their live shows with two violinists and a female vocalist—the band swapped out guitar and bass for dual keyboards.**************Tommy Gear, who co-wrote most of the band’s songs with du Plenty, played an ARP Odyssey synthesizer, and David Brown mutated the sound of his Fender Rhodes by channeling it through a Big Muff distortion pedal.**************David Brown’s Fender Rhodes played through his Big Muff distortion pedal sound-**************255**************0.35294117647058826
Griselda Records has earned a reputation for flooding every market they touch.**************The Buffalo collective’s six active members—nominal leader Westside Gunn, Conway the Machine, Benny the Butcher, Armani Caesar, and latest signees Boldy James and YN Billy—released a combined seven projects in 2020 and have also exerted their influence in the worlds of fashion, sports, and wrestling.**************Buffalo’s Westside Gunn, Conway the Machine and BennyThe Butcher have formed their collective in 20**************174**************0.34375
James is looser than Mobb Deep, less eager-to-please than the punchline-happy Clipse; he orbits the Griselda universe, but they need him more than he needs them.**************December’s Real Bad Boldy is a full-length tryst with Real Bad Man, who, per their Bandcamp, “is a crew from Los Angeles that makes clothing but also happens to have fire-ass beats.” The conceit isn’t unprecedented—Conway the Machine recorded an entire tape credited to a streetwear line in 2019—and while I can’t speak to their $60 t-shirts, Real Bad Boldy’s 10 tracks corroborate the latter claim.**************2019’s The Real Bad Man—on a tape that also happens to have tracks from Boldy who makes beats with an entire crew in Los Angeles “and I can speak their**************333**************0.35514018691588783
Then, with “Martyrr,” a brief blast of noise—electrical static, a broken air conditioner, who knows—gives way to the mournful singing of a Christian monk, who is himself displaced, in “Bitterness,” by the sad, sour tones of plucked strings looped against keening, minor-key melodies.**************At times like these, Yin-Wong’s use of texture, contrast, and flow gives her arrangements an unmistakably musical, even lyrical character, like a dark-ambient DJ set accompanied by the tin-roof rattling of a Foley artist.**************The set’s dark musicality and lyrical texture gives even these simple arrangements an unmistakably Eurodance character like UK garage artist DJ San**************239**************0.2950819672131147
Kid brother Tessela is the drum machine, able to slice an Amen break 50 ways.**************You’d think a hybrid of these impulses would be tough as a bouncer’s boot, but their releases as Overmono, mainly for the rave-rooted XL Recordings, are vivid and accessible, keeping ruffneck drums in check with smiley-face signifiers and notes of ’90s euphoria.**************“You’d think drums would be tough in a rave scenario but with their pace of releases and influence as essential signifiers for ’9s-rooted generation XL Recordings helped these ruffneck bouncer bootface foot notes**************190**************0.4197530864197531

Under the Spell of Joy is not a soundtrack for eating cheeseburgers—it’s music for barfing up the poison in your soul.**************Death Valley Girls have always dabbled in the language and iconography of the occult—the title Under the Spell of Joy isn’t much of a thematic stretch for a group whose repertoire already includes “Love Spell”—but this time they dial down the camp to harness its sinister allure and ceremonial grandeur.**************The title and its thematic centerpiece “Death Valley Girls”—the group have always dabbled sinister occult iconography this time they dial down camp to harness apocalyptic grandeur**************192**************0.4

In between, they made one pivotal album that mined the hookiest qualities of the former iteration while laying the groundwork for the latter.**************Stacked with eminently catchy songs from top to bottom that sound evergreen in ways that evaded so much pop music from the same era, Listen Like Thieves is a classic “verge album”—think Fleetwood Mac, Soundgarden’s Badmotorfinger, R.E.M.’s Green, or U2’s The Unforgettable Fire—a mid-career highlight where a fully formed, fully confident band finds its footing at the precipice of something much bigger and maybe just beyond their control.**************The band’s mid-career swing from pop to grunge is a classic “band at war with its sound”—think U2 or Fleetwood Mac—an era in their music where something exciting and dangerous lives just beyond control**************557**************0.24561403508771928
If you’ve been a fan for long enough, chances are it’s a few.**************The trio’s ability to morph into a kind of living covers jukebox is nearly as legendary as their propensity for making non-Jews care about Hanukkah, and if you always thought “You Can Have It All” was an original, you’re not the only one—it’s a testament to the band’s knack for taking any unsung gem and rearranging it until it’s unmistakably a Yo La Tengo song.**************And if the song is “You Can Have It All” and not one of their covers—it was about as unlikely an addition to any jukebox-less band into making only original until nearly always forgotten side trio Yo La Tengo**************224**************0.2831858407079646
Four years later came “A Boy Named Sue,” a near-novelty written by Silverstein and delivered with thundering menace by Cash—a combination that gave the Man In Black his biggest hit and opened up Nashville for its songwriter.**************Silverstein found some kindred spirits in Nashville—he wrote Waylon Jennings’ 1970 hit “The Taker” with Kris Kristofferson and authored Loretta Lynn’s 1971 “One’s on the Way” on his own—but he discovered his muse in Bobby Bare, a towering progressive country singer who had been kicking around Nashville for over a decade.**************And in 1970, he wrote Kris Kristofferson’s version on country singer Waylon Jennings who had been kicking around Bobby Bare”**************597**************0.3684210526315789
Much of her time behind the mic yields only wordless expressions—coos, sighs, wisps of tinted air.**************The first time we hear her voice, 30 seconds into her debut EP’s lead track, “Ischia,” it takes the form of a single reversed syllable, glinting like an apparition before it disappears into velvety dub delay: the echo of a shadow of a specter that haunts a decades-old memory of the dancefloor.**************It’s a voice we rarely hear: 30 seconds into “The Day,” it takes an echo-tinting delay before that first single syllable strikes like faint memory ringing deadweight melodies floating ghost tracks dancing dancefloor**************254**************0.2696629213483146
With Spell My Name, Braxton upholds her position as an originator of the sound of 1990s R&B.**************Though long-time collaborators Babyface and Antonio Dixon once again assist in production, Braxton asserts more agency than her previous album, 2018’s Sex & Cigarettes, by writing and producing a significant amount of the record.**************On a production by long-time collaborators Babyface and Antonio Dixon more in touch than previous album Sex & Cigarettes**************166**************0.4814814814814815
Reggae legend Toots Hibbert’s decades-long streak of sweaty, impressively athletic live shows came to a halt in 2013, after he was struck in the head by a vodka bottle during one of them.**************Hibbert filed a $21 million lawsuit against the 19-year-old who threw the bottle, but in a letter to a judge he pleaded that the man be sentenced to no jail time.**************$9 million lawsuit filed against man who threw but no jail time**************177**************0.39999999999999997
It’s called “Old D-35,” and Chapin dedicates it to John Jennings, the guitarist and producer who worked with Chapin on her 1987 debut Hometown Girl through her commercial breakthroughs in the ’90s.**************Singing to her old friend, who died from cancer in 2015, Chapin finds a sense of peace in the music he left behind: “As long as there are songs that sound like rain on an old terne roof,” she sings, letting her accompanists finish the thought with a fragile, descending piano line.**************The songs sound like an old friend as she sings from a long line of music that he left behind: there are fragile piano accompanists**************153**************0.33766233766233766
For decades, the cowboy has been a beacon for those who see their own loneliness reflected in the figure’s migratory lifestyle and estrangement.**************Though Orville Peck is a pseudonym, the singer believes it’s his most sincere project, “the most exposed that I’ve ever been.” But the contemporary trend for rodeo aesthetics has encouraged skeptics to receive Peck—a former punk musician who drummed in the Vancouver trio Nü Sensae—as a gimmick.**************But is it that easy to project his identity—as “the most original style I ever copy cat.” singer Orville Peck shares contemporary gay rodeo musician Nu Sensae**************241**************0.27848101265822783
By 1994, he was an artist of some repute, having led his Invaders of the Heart, a globe-trotting collective of musical mavericks, to the middle reaches of the British charts.**************All the same, you can picture the flicker of delight that must have traced across Eno’s brow when he received back his musical cues alternatively untouched (“Garden Recalled”), employed as the basis for entirely new tracks (“Steam”), and accompanied by Wobble’s bass pressure (“Like Organza”).**************“All that’s new you can have back and as for rest restored by feverous delight (“Like”), meanwhile received considerable bass pressure when placed**************191**************0.28169014084507044

His music attempts to capture the essence of transcendent experiences, like the glorious, humbling feeling of being dwarfed by the immensity of nature, or the calm, gauzy moment between consciousness and sleep.**************He falls into the lineage of minimalists like John Luther Adams, Terry Riley, and Gavin Bryars, composers that evoke the personal revelation of existential beauty, and there are moments in Moore’s discography that live up to that spiritual and emotional ambition.**************But there are moments in John Luther Adams’s discography that evoke personal spiritual revelation into existential beauty up**************236**************0.3278688524590164
What followed King’s nervous aside is the most normal thing to happen at a Japandroids show: they end with “The House That Heaven Built,” a song that King has admitted he cannot sing for the life of him.**************Even Japandroids’ most evangelical fans know that King and David Prowse can’t really pull of most of their vocals live; those “whoa”s and “yeah”s don’t quite hit the same when it’s really two guys doing it, as opposed to two guys overdubbed to sound like 250.**************David Prowse can, and as their 250 fans jump like those same two guys when it hit live overdubbed synthesizers sound really quite extraordinary**************256**************0.2933333333333333

It might even be better: Henn has given Chunklet some of his most memorable material, and hearing all of it together adds extra adrenaline.**************What makes the songs on Sing the Snow Away memorable is Henn’s knack for creating a classic, where-have-I-heard-this-before aura while adding idiosyncratic accents.**************He’s a knack for creating songs where the classic is on repeat while adding idiosyncratic accents**************146**************0.391304347826087
“Pathways” plays out against a backdrop of a kalimba fed through delay, with bassist Matt Ulery channeling Charlie Haden for a solo of contemplative modal runs up and down his instrument before being joined by Nate Lepine’s searching flute.**************As the metallic chime of the kalimba loops, the piece seamlessly transforms into a version of Kelan Phil Cohran’s “Sahara,” its ostinato bass line passed around the ensemble as Kirchner dances around his kit.**************The bass line transforms into the ostinato “rhythmic language,” as Kelan Phil Cohran puts its use around experimental ensemble**************184**************0.3333333333333333
The rest of the album follows this thread: furnished with more space than his words require, sung gracefully at the age of 79, speaking to things we know to be true, using proper nouns and first-hand evidence.**************In other words, it is the rare Dylan album that asks to be understood, that comes down to meet its audience.**************He is asking questions that call upon other questioners it asks its audience do get answers**************450**************0.27027027027027023

Listening to a Gunna album or tape is easy and familiar, like turning on the television and landing on a marathon of your favorite sitcom.**************The difference between Gunna’s best verses and his worst is at the molecular level: The best are easily recitable and bring color to his lavish lifestyle; the worst are basically the same except it just sounds like he’s going through the motions.**************The sounds he’s best at are easily his worst; it just becomes tiresome going through same motions: endless boasts between lavish lifestyle verses(“The color red drip Rick Owens Dior Jordan bag Prada watch Audemars**************119**************0.325
He’s been much more interested in playing with people across the avant-garde spectrum, from free jazz veterans Joe McPhee and Mats Gustaffson to rock musicians Steve Gunn and Thurston Moore to polymaths Okkyung Lee and Kim Gordon (partner in his most well-known venture, Body/Head).**************All this collaboration has defined Nace, but it’s also made him something of a cipher.**************But it has also made him something of a cipher.**************167**************0.6923076923076923
The beats he raps on, his own productions or sourced from a tight circle of collaborators, do away with nearly all extraneous elements—and often with elements that no one would consider “extraneous,” like drums.**************There are complicated lyrical passages, but some of Ka’s phrasing is disarmingly simple: He’ll say he “saw too much to have blind faith,” or describe the Brownsville, Brooklyn neighborhood of his youth as “the bottom” where “all the tops is slung.” It’s this drive toward the essential that makes Ka’s music singular.**************That’s to say: He makes music where the essential is as disarmingly simple but much too complicated.””You have this singular drive toward some spiritual home land whether It s Los Angeles**************349**************0.2247191011235955
It’s a mental rut that Apparition’s beguiling eight minutes seek to remedy.**************All three songs on the EP were produced by Wynne Bennett, who lent a similarly delicate touch to Janelle Monáe’s Dirty Computer highlight “Pynk.” Bennett’s understated production is a good fit for Wise, who continues to use his voice to land emotional haymakers.**************“All three songs on the EP were produced by Janelle Monáe, who is good for his voice.”**************129**************0.53125
Roedelius was conscripted into the East German army as a teen, and later attempted to defect to the West; he successfully made it across in 1961, after two years in an East German prison.**************When he began making music in the late ’60s, it came out chaotic and primal, but over the following 50 years, both solo and as a member of Cluster and Harmonia, Roedelius has been one of the most influential and prolific members of the original wave of German experimental rock.**************Harmonia has been one of experimental rock music ’s most influential but prolific members over both original member**************209**************0.29411764705882354

Edwards showed you didn’t necessarily have to be a renegade club kid to cut it in this new world.**************British producers upped the ante, making the basslines chunkier and altering the straight-ahead flow of garage house, so that MCs crossing over from hardcore and jungle raves could find moments within DJ sets to command and conquer the dance.**************While most of the raves and house-party DJ sets that birthed jungle, including MCs whose voices crackled over basslines ripped straight from Busta Rhymes instrumentals never got further than local radio plugger Mike Skinner could find himself within**************928**************0.2531645569620253
