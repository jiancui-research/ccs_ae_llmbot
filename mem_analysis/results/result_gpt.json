      "full": "Republican presidential hopefuls will face off tonight for the final time in 2015 as CNN airs the GOP debate from Las Vegas. &quot;Businessman Donald Trump, the front-runner for the nomination, will again be center stage flanked by retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson on his right and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz on his left, CNN announced Sunday. The six remaining participants in the prime-time contest will be Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, businesswoman Carly Fiorina, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, Ohio Gov. John Kasich, and Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul,&quot; CNN reports. That begins at 7:30 p.m. central. At 5 p.m. central, four lower-polling GOP candidates will debate. Those four candidates -- former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum, South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham and former New York Gov. George Pataki -- will appear in the first debate on Tuesday evening. Going into tonight&#x27;s debate, Cruz is challenging Trump for the lead in the kickoff Iowa caucus and casting himself as a more electable alternative who still shares the bombastic billionaire&#x27;s anti-Washington appeal. Trump and Cruz have been friendly on the campaign trail for months. But signs of a split have emerged in recent days, with Cruz appearing to question Trump&#x27;s judgment at a private fundraiser, according to audio obtained by The New York Times, and Trump calling Cruz &quot;a little bit of a maniac.&quot; Another intriguing dynamic in Tuesday&#x27;s prime-time debate in Las Vegas involves Cruz and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, another first-term senator and Cuban-American. Cruz and Rubio have been sparring from afar for weeks, particularly over national security, which is now a top campaign issue following the attacks in Paris and San Bernardino, California. Rubio has tried to brand Cruz as an isolationist and has criticized his support for ending the bulk collection of Americans&#x27; phone records, saying it weakens the government&#x27;s ability to identify potential terrorists. &quot;There are some differences in policy,&quot; Rubio said of Cruz in an interview Monday with The Associated Press. &quot;I think we need to be the national security party, the party of strong national security, committed to ensuring we have the strongest military force in the world.&quot; With just six weeks until voting begins, the broad contours of the race remain consistent. Trump still sits atop the GOP field, displaying a talent for connecting with voters frustrated with Washington and on edge about the threat of terrorism. He continues to make controversial comments that might disqualify more traditional candidates, including his recent call for a ban on Muslims entering the U.S. For struggling candidates, the debates will be one of their last opportunities to change the trajectory of their campaigns before voting begins in Iowa Feb. 1. The stakes are particularly high for Bush, who was once seen as a front-runner for the Republican nomination and has raised more money than any other candidate. Bush has scoffed at suggestions that he should drop out of the race before voting begins. But that idea is likely to build if he delivers another lackluster debate performance.",

While the trend is seen nationwide, there are some states where firearm ownership is more common. CBS News took a look at that fact recently when it ranked the 30 most heavily armed states in America. The ranking was determined using the ATF&#x27;s National Firearms Registration and Transfer Record, and 2013 data from the U.S. Census Bureau. Keep in mind these are guns that are registered via the ATF or self-reported through the Census Bureau - determining the exact number of firearms in a state is virtually impossible. Alabama came in at number seven on the list. The figures show there are 20 guns for every 1,000 Alabama residents, for a total of 96,744 registered firearms for 4.8 million people.",

      "full": "Psych unit.jpg Inside an intake unit at Brookwood Medical Center, which was one of seven hospitals penalized for injuries and infections in 2015. Brookwood was also penalized in 2014. (Amy Yurkanin|ayurkanin@al.com) Seven hospitals in Alabama will lose some Medicare funding for failing to prevent infections and injuries among patients, according to Kaiser Health News. The Alabama hospitals join more than 750 across the country that have been penalized for falling into the bottom 25 percent for infections and injuries that occur in the facility. The seven Alabama hospitals penalized under the program are Brookwood Medical Center, L.V. Stabler Memorial Hospital, Springhill Medical Center, Shoals Hospital, Russellville Hospital, DCH Regional Medical Center and Northwest Medical center. Brookwood, Springhill, DCH Regional and Russellville Hospital were also penalized last year, in the first year of the program. All hospitals on the list lose 1 percent of their Medicare funding as a penalty in the 2016 fiscal year. Scores are determined by measuring how frequently patients get certain kinds of urinary-tract and blood infections, and injuries such as hip fractures. The penalties for hospital-acquired conditions passed as part of the 2010 Affordable Care Act. The goal of the penalties is to improve quality and reduce preventable injuries at acute care hospitals, but they are controversial. Rosemary Blackmon, vice president of the Alabama Hospital Association, said the penalties are problematic. The penalty will always apply to the bottom quartile of hospitals, regardless of whether they have made improvements in terms of safety. The difference between hospitals that are penalized and those that are not can come down to a fraction of a percentage, which doesn&#x27;t seem fair, she said. &quot;Reducing funding can be really harmful, because so many of these hospitals are already operating in the red,&quot; Blackmon said. The list includes some of the most highly-regarded hospitals in the country, and critics say the measure doesn&#x27;t properly take into account the risks of caring for the most medically-complex patients, who may be more prone to infections or injuries. Brad Fisher, spokesman for DCH Regional Medical Center, emailed a statement in response to the penalty. &quot;We don&#x27;t believe the HAC measures are well designed because by law, the program must impose penalties on 25 percent of hospitals each year. Many of those hospitals tend to be hospitals like DCH Regional Medical Center and University of Alabama Hospital, who see large numbers of poorer and sicker patients. It is DCH&#x27;s mission to serve all patients who come to us for care. We find it unfortunate that we and other similar hospitals are penalized for doing so.&quot; Jeff St. Clair, president and CEO of Springhill Medical Center, said the hospital reduced the number of catheter-acquired urinary-tract infections by half, from 30 to 15. But the hospital was still penalized because it was measured based on days of catheter use, which had also fallen by half. &quot;We are still being penalized because of how they do the math,&quot; St. Clair said. St. Clair said that Springhill had only 15 catheter-associated urinary-tract infections last year, and was deemed to be excellent at preventing hospital-acquired infections by Blue Cross Blue Shield of Alabama. Springhill will lose about $500,000 from Medicare in the upcoming year, he said. &quot;It is not an insignificant amount of money for us,&quot; St. Clair said. &quot;For us, that&#x27;s painful.&quot; Although the University of Alabama Hospital in Birmingham was penalized last year, the hospital did not make the list this year. Executives at the health system in a statement they made a concerted effort to focus on safety. &quot;Patient safety and quality care are major components of everything we do at UAB Medicine&quot; said Will Ferniany, CEO of the UAB Health System, in an emailed statement. &quot;Quality is an agenda item at every meeting of the Health System Board of Directors and we hold special board meetings annually that are devoted to quality issues. We have also developed a certificate course and a  Masters level curriculum at the UAB School of Health Professions to train physicians and other health care providers and administrators in quality management.&quot; The UAB Health System began analyzing data to determine where to focus improvement efforts, said Anthony Patterson, senior vice president for inpatient services, in a statement. &quot;These efforts have been extremely successful in in improving the quality of care and enhancing the patient experience at UAB,&quot; he said. Blackmon said Alabama hospitals have been working hard for years to reduce injuries and infections.

      "full": "Standing amidst hundreds if not thousands of sandhill cranes in a field at the Wheeler National Wildlife Refuge, the handful of critically endangered whooping cranes that make the refuge their winter home can&#x27;t help but stand out. At a height of around five feet, the whoopers are nearly a foot taller than the sandhills, and their brilliant white feathers and black wingtips offer a stark contrast to their close relative&#x27;s mottled gray. &quot;It would be pretty hard to confuse them with the other birds that you might see,&quot; said Lizzie Condon, the Keep Whooping Cranes Safe coordinator for the International Crane Foundation. &quot;People say &#x27;I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;ll be able to tell the difference,&#x27; but once you see one it really jumps out at you.&quot; It&#x27;s a striking sight and one that was nearly lost forever. According to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the total population of whooping cranes dropped to about 15 birds in the 1940s. The wetland dependent whooping cranes lost significant swaths of habitat to human development, and like the coastal roseate spoonbills that are returning to south Alabama, were frequently hunted for feathers. Condon said the wild population is now up to about 600 individuals, exponentially more than the 15 holdouts who carried the species past World War II, but still hardly a stable population. Condon said there are currently at least six whoopers in Wheeler NWR right now, with the first arrivals landing on Nov. 14. That was slightly later than last year, when the birds arrived Nov. 1. Last winter, a total of 36 whooping cranes were spotted in Alabama before the birds began their northward migration in March and April. Condon hopes this year the total will be more than 40. &quot;The count goes up every year, so hopefully we&#x27;ll continue that trend,&quot; Condon said. Now that the cranes are back in Alabama, a steady stream of birders have followed them to the wildlife refuge. &quot;There are people that we call &#x27;craniacs&#x27;, people who go there every day or spend significant amounts of time watching the whooping cranes,&quot; Condon said. &quot;There are definitely people here who care about the cranes, we&#x27;re just trying to help get the word out.&quot; The refuge features an indoor observation building with unobstructed views of common whooping crane sighting areas, and Condon said the cranes can even sometimes be seen from the visitors center. Both are free and open to the public. &quot;I think Alabama&#x27;s really lucky in that you do have a very good public viewing site for whooping cranes,&quot; Condon said. &quot;In Texas people pay to take boats to go see them, but here you can just roll into the parking lot at Wheeler and there they are.&quot; In addition to the everyday viewing opportunities, there are a handful of special events in and around the refuge to celebrate the whoopers. The refuge will host a Festival of the Cranes on Jan. 9-10, 2016, with viewing opportunities, educational programming and even a Teddy Roosevelt impersonator. The Old Black Bear Brewing Company in Madison will release a limited edition whooping crane red ale on Jan. 8, with half the proceeds from sales going to whooping crane conservation efforts. Tim Baker sees the whoopers nearly every day on his family&#x27;s land adjacent to the refuge, but made it clear that he&#x27;s no &quot;craniac.&quot; The avid outdoorsman and waterfowl hunter does, however, appreciate the birds&#x27; return to the area around Wheeler like he appreciates the many other species in the area. &quot;The whooping crane has such a distinct call, there&#x27;s no other sound like it,&quot; Baker said. &quot;It&#x27;s like some kind of pure, wild historic sound and it&#x27;s so large that it&#x27;s really a &#x27;shock and awe&#x27; kind of a bird, especially when you get one close. &quot;When it calls out, you&#x27;ll take notice, I can promise you that.&quot; Baker said he still remembers his first close encounter with the whoopers, which happened around 2010. He was working on a duck blind for the approaching hunting season when three of the whoopers flew directly over his head about 30 feet up. &quot;I&#x27;ll never forget the first time I really saw them up close and personal,&quot; Baker said. &quot;It was sort of a pea-soup fog and I heard the sound so I looked up and it looked like three 747s in the air. &quot;I&#x27;d seen them out in the field, but that was at like a quarter mile and you can&#x27;t tell much.

      "full": "A widespread fish kill is underway across Mobile Bay. It appears to be affecting primarily filter-feeding fish such as menhaden, sardines, alewives and shad. Dead fish are present in the shallows and on beaches on both sides of the bay, from Point Clear to Daphne on the eastern shore and from Arlington Point south to Fowl River on the western shore. Dead and dying fish also dot the surface of the bay, from one side to the other. The kill does not appear to be related to a red tide bloom occurring in the Gulf of Mexico and around Dauphin Island. Instead, the bloom in the upper bay appears to be another species of algae with a similar neurotoxic effect on fish. Fish affected by the algae swim in a markedly erratic fashion, zipping straight ahead for a time, then falling into lazy circles, often swimming on their side or even upside down. AL.com collected samples of sick fish and the water where they were found during trips across the bay, from Fairhope to the mouth of Fowl River, on both Tuesday and Wednesday. Those fish were provided to the Dauphin Island Sea Lab for analysis. In addition, AL.com measured oxygen levels and salinity where the samples were collected using a YSI meter, a standard tool for environmental sampling. &quot;There does not appear to be a correlation with oxygen or salinity,&quot; said Andy Depaola, a microbiologist with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration lab on Dauphin Island. Depaola participated in the AL.com sampling trip. &quot;Those oxygen levels were not low enough to kill fish.&quot; Alison Robertson, who specializes in harmful algal blooms with the Dauphin Island Sea Lab, said she had ruled out red tide, which is caused by an organism called Karenia brevis, in the bay. The red tide algae prefers the high salinity found in the Gulf of Mexico. It does not do well in lower salinity, particularly the low levels of salt measured in the AL.com sampling. Robertson said she had received numerous reports of dead fish from locations all around the bay. She is working to isolate the algae causing the problem. &quot;Along the Gulf coast, Destin to Dauphin Island, we have had many fish kills over the past 7 weeks that we have shown were associated with Karenia (red tide) blooms offshore,&quot; Robertson said.The toxins associated with red tide were found in the guts and flesh of fish from those kills. &quot;The fish kills being seen in and around Mobile Bay at the moment are inconsistent with that, and there are in many cases none or at least very low numbers of Karenia in the Bay waters that we have tested alongside affected fish,&quot; Robertson said. &quot;Lots of small menhaden are being reported in many areas -- from Weeks Bay to Fairhope, to Fowl River -- exhibiting spiraled swimming or swimming sideways. We tested dissolved oxygen in over 26 sites over the past 2 days and everything looks great, levels between 7-10 mg/L which is exactly what we would expect based on the water temperature.&quot; Robertson said her lab was investigating whether there was another phytoplankton species affecting the fish. She said that other most other algal species do not pose a human health concern. &quot;We are following those leads right now,&quot; Robertson said. &quot;A few fish collected were dissected and examined under microscope but there are no overt signs of problems and the gills look healthy.&quot; She noted that all of the samples provided to her by AL.com were small juveniles. &quot;While this is concerning and we will continue to look at the cause of the kills, we are really only seeing the very small planktivores being affected at the moment,&quot; Robertson said. &quot;And fish such as menhaden are particularly sensitive to changes in their environment.&quot; Dead or dying fish were visible at all times during the AL.com trips across the bay. Pelicans were seen swimming around on the surface of the bay scooping the dead fish out of the water. Likewise, pods of dolphins were seen gorging on the stricken fish.",

Sen. Richard Shelby (R-Ala.) voted no, and Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) voted yes, mirroring their votes yesterday to end debate on the bill. Both Senators voted for the original passage of No Child Left Behind (NCLB). Shelby released this statement yesterday ahead of the vote: &quot;While this bill may be well-intentioned and makes some improvements to our current policy, it is a missed opportunity to truly put an end to unnecessary federal intervention into education.  I have always believed that education decisions should be made at a local level and that Congress should empower parents and teachers - not Washington bureaucrats.  Instead, this bill extends some of the same failed policies that could provide a path for top-down federal mandates like Common Core. I know that local communities make better decisions for their students, parents, teachers, and administrators than Washington does.  That is why I will continue to fight against bureaucratic red-tape and misguided policies like Common Core.  It&#x27;s time to restore local control over our nation&#x27;s education system and get Washington out of our classrooms.&quot; In an email to its members yesterday, the conservative Eagle Forum of Alabama urged members to contact and tell Alabama&#x27;s Senators to vote no, stating that ESSA actually expands the federal government&#x27;s role further than it ultimately repeals the &quot;excesses&quot; of NCLB, citing federal funding for preschool and community learning centers as examples of areas in which the federal government should not be involved.  &quot;For our Republic to prosper, states must be allowed to handle education once again,&quot; read the Eagle Forum&#x27;s suggested letter to Alabama&#x27;s senators. In very real ways, ESSA returns some control to the states, including forbidding the U.S. Secretary of Education from coercing or incentivizing states to adopt any particular academic standards and instead leaving it up to states to adopt &quot;challenging&quot; academic standards. However, ESSA does keep essential parts of NCLB intact, including yearly testing for students in grades 3 through 8. And it adds a requirement to test students in science at three different times in grades 3 through 12. In addition, test results must still be broken down, or disaggregated, by subgroups and publicly reported. What to do about those results remains a state decision. The federal measure of Adequate Yearly Progress is gone forever. Here are the highlights of ESSA. The White House released this blog post about ESSA on Monday.",

Francis declared the Jubilee year in the spring, calling it a &quot;Holy Year of Mercy.&quot; The Jubilee will begin Dec. 8, coinciding with the end of the Second Vatican Council, and end on Nov. 26, 2016 with the Feast of Christ the King. In a tradition that dates back to the 1500s, the pope will open the Holy Doors at St. Peter&#x27;s to signal the start of the special year. Tradition states that parishioners must use one of the Holy Doors in the four Basilicas of Rome to receive their indulgences for sin and reconciliation with Christ. Francis did away with that tradition, however, encouraging Catholics around the world to walk through any door to symbolically start the year. In return, Catholics are asked to use the year to deepen their relationship with God. &quot;I am convinced that the whole church will be able to find in this Jubilee the joy of rediscovering and making fruitful the mercy of God, with which we are all called to give consolation to every man and every woman of our time,&quot; Pope Francis said while making the Jubilee announcement. The year will also include hundreds of &quot;missionaries of mercy,&quot; or priests who will travel the world to meet with parishioners and hear confession. The missionaries will be a fulfillment of the year&#x27;s motto, &quot;Merciful Like the Father,&quot; and serve as an &quot;invitation to follow the merciful example of the Father who asks us not to judge or condemn but to forgive and to give love and forgiveness without measure,&quot; Vatican officials said. The Catholic church generally holds a Jubilee celebration every 25 or so years. The last Jubilee was held in 2000, declared by Pope John Paul III as the &quot;Great Jubilee.&quot; The event in Rome will be attended by hundreds of thousands of Catholics as well as Francis&#x27;s predecessor, Benedict XVI, who has lived in seclusion within the Vatican since retiring in 2013 due to failing health.

Scott Applewhite) (J. Scott Applewhite) WASHINGTON (AP) -- Openly welcoming a preordained veto, Republicans drove legislation to Senate passage Thursday aimed at crippling two of their favorite targets: President Barack Obama&#x27;s health care law and Planned Parenthood. With a House rubber stamp expected in days, the bill would be the first to reach Obama&#x27;s desk demolishing his 2010 health care overhaul, one of his proudest domestic achievements, and halting federal payments to Planned Parenthood. Congress has voted dozens of times to repeal or weaken the health law and several times against Planned Parenthood&#x27;s funding, but until now Democrats thwarted Republicans from shipping the legislation to the White House. Thursday&#x27;s vote was a near party-line 52-47. Republicans said an Obama veto -- which the White House has promised -- will underscore that a GOP triumph in next year&#x27;s presidential and congressional elections would mean repeal of a statute they blame for surging medical costs and insurers abandoning some markets. They lack the two-thirds House and Senate majorities needed to override vetoes, assuring that the bill&#x27;s chief purpose will be for campaign talking points. &quot;President Obama will have a choice,&quot; said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. &quot;He can defend a status quo that&#x27;s failed the middle class by vetoing the bill, or he can work toward a new beginning and better care by signing it.&quot; Republicans blame the bill for surging health care costs and insurers abandoning some markets. Government officials said this week that health care spending grew at 5.3 percent in 2014, the steepest climb since Obama took office. Democrats noted that under the law, millions of people have become insured and said their coverage has improved, with policies now required to insure a wide range of medical services. &quot;Do they talk to their constituents? Do they meet with them?&quot; Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., said of Republicans. With just a 54-46 edge, Republicans had until now been unable to push such legislation through the Senate. This time, they used a special budget procedure that prevents filibusters -- delays that take 60 votes to halt -- and lets them prevail with 51 votes. Party leaders initially encountered objections from some more moderate Republicans leery of cutting Planned Parenthood&#x27;s funds and from presidential contenders, Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas and Marco Rubio of Florida, who threatened to oppose the measure if it wasn&#x27;t strong enough. In the end, Cruz and Rubio voted &quot;yes.&quot; Moderate GOP Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Mark Kirk of Illinois voted no, the only lawmakers to cross party lines, while Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., did not vote. The Senate bill would all but erase the health care overhaul by dismantling some of its key pillars, such as requirements that most people obtain coverage and larger employers offer it to workers. Also eliminated would be its expansion of Medicaid coverage to additional lower-income people and the government&#x27;s subsidies for many who buy policies on newly created insurance marketplaces, such as HealthCare.gov. And it would end taxes the law imposed to cover its costs, including levies on higher-income people, expensive insurance policies, medical devices and indoor tanning salons. The bill would also terminate the roughly $450 million yearly in federal dollars that go to Planned Parenthood, about a third of its budget. Federal funds can be used for abortions only in rare cases.",

The former track star is currently under house arrest at his uncle&#x27;s mansion in Pretoria. &quot;The accused ought to have been found guilty of murder on the basis that he had fired the fatal shots with criminal intent,&quot; Leach said to the courtroom, in which Steenkamp&#x27;s mother sat. A 15-year prison sentence is the minimum punishment for murder in South Africa. However, the law allows for a lesser sentence to be imposed in exceptional circumstances. Pistorius was placed under house arrest in October after serving one year in prison. He had been sentenced to five years in prison for manslaughter and got out early in line with corrections department regulations. The trial court can also consider whether he should be shown leniency because he is disabled and is a first-time offender. Pistorius, 29, killed Steenkamp in the early morning of Valentine&#x27;s Day. He insisted he thought she was an intruder behind the door of a toilet cubicle in his home. The prosecution said Pistorius shot Steenkamp during an argument. Leach said regardless of who might have been behind the door, Pistorius should have known someone could be killed if he fired. &quot;The identity of his victim is irrelevant to his guilt,&quot; the judge said. Under the concept of &quot;dolus eventualis&quot; in South African law, a person can be convicted of murder if they foresaw the possibility of someone dying through their actions and went ahead anyway. Reeva Steenkamp&#x27;s mother, June, sat quietly in the courtroom during the announcement, which was shown live on television. Pistorius was not there.",

Trump and Republican leaders of Congress have vowed they will repeal the Affordable Care Act, the 2010 health care overhaul that is generally supported by large hospital systems. It wasn&#x27;t clear whether the issue was discussed. Mayo Clinic said in a statement that Noseworthy was invited to discuss &quot;his perspective on the future of health care delivery, research and excellence,&quot; including applying principles developed at the Mayo Clinic to improve U.S. health care.

Clinton, the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee, handled over 55,000 emails to U.S. officials investigating the allegations but did not release about 30,000 emails she said were personal in nature. The State Department and National Archives both took steps to recover the emails but did not ask the U.S. Attorney General to take enforcement action. In his ruling, Williams said the two agencies should have done more. Massive sinkhole forces evacuation A massive sinkhole in Michigan has forced the evacuation of 22 homes.

Engineers are now scrambling to redirect sewage from the pipe into a nearby river after rainfall threatened to cause the waste to flood basements in the neighborhood.

The web address has not yet been released. The public will be able to search by school and will be shown scores in areas of achievement and performance, depending on whether a school has a twelfth grade. For schools with a twelfth grade, student achievement and a combination of four- and five-year graduation rates will be listed. For all other schools, student achievement and how student achievement has grown from one school year to the next, known as learning gains, will be listed. While this year&#x27;s report card just represents phase one, Rep. Terri Collins, R-Decatur, said she is pleased that it will be published on Friday. Collins, an original sponsor of the law, said experience has shown that when states begin using an easy-to-understand report card, &quot;the accountability brings a certain step up in achievement.&quot; This year&#x27;s report card also shows information related to a &quot;local indicator&quot; chosen by local school officials that reflects an area in which they are working to improve or enrich their students. Parents should contact their local school for details on what that local indicator will be, according to the state department&#x27;s spokesperson. In December 2017, additional indicators will be published on the report card, including learning gains and college- and career-ready indicators for schools with a twelfth grade, and achievement gap information for all other schools. Though the state law, passed unanimously in 2012 in both the House and the Senate, calls for letter grades A through F to be used, the state board of education dropped that requirement when they approved final rules for the report card in November. Collins has been a strong supporter of the use of a school report card since its passage. While she supports the use of letter grades, she said she believes issuing the report cards without grades this year helps schools establish a baseline, readying them for grades to be assigned next December. And though state superintendent Michael Sentance said he is not a fan of using the A through F grading system for schools, Collins said, &quot;I believe this is still a step in the right direction to help him achieve the success he wants with student achievement that we all want to see.&quot; Collins said labeling a school with a &quot;D&quot; or an &quot;F&quot; shouldn&#x27;t be what is most worrisome. She said the low achievement of students is where that concern should be placed. &quot;Our focus should be on students that are in a school that is failing, not what we&#x27;re labeling it,&quot; Collins said. Sentance could not be reached for comment prior to publication. Craig Pouncey is superintendent of the 36,000-student Jefferson County school district. He has seen his district&#x27;s results and said, &quot;While I know we have a lot of work to do, I was pleased that 85 percent of our students showed significant growth.&quot; Pouncey said growth is the key, &quot;not who has the highest or who has the lowest, but how far you can move your children in the right direction.&quot; In that respect, the report card is missing some key information, Pouncey said. Some of what is missing is the differences among students from one school to the next. &quot;You have to consider the percentage of students that are in poverty, special education, and English Language learners,&quot; Pouncey said, because of the different challenges those students bring with them to school.",

      "full": "jamie lee wallace.JPG Jamie Lee Wallace committed suicide on Dec. 15, days after he testified in a trial about mental health care in Alabama prisons. (The Birmingham News/Tamika Moore) ( Tamika Moore|tmoore@al.com) Attorneys representing Alabama inmates in a federal trial are seeking emergency action to improve suicide prevention in prisons following the hanging death of one of their clients. Jamie Wallace, 24, died on Dec. 15, less than two weeks after he testified on the opening day of the trial challenging the adequacy of mental health care in Alabama prisons. The convicted murderer was moved to a stabilization unit in Bullock Correctional Facility after he testified, and placed on suicide watch on Dec. 10. Prison employees released Wallace from suicide watch on Dec. 13, and he hung himself two days later, according to the emergency motion. This morning, attorneys from the Southern Poverty Law Center filed the emergency motion, which would require immediate improvements to suicide watch and risk assessments. On Tuesday, associate commissioner Ruth Naglich testified that many prisoners on suicide watch do not receive constant monitoring. Not all prisons are equipped with video monitoring or layout that facilitates easy observation. &quot;Throughout the four days of her testimony, Ms. Naglich made clear that she<br/>has done little to nothing to rectify the problems with the provision of mental<br/>health care to acutely suicidal prisoners and prisoners at risk of becoming acutely suicidal,&quot; read the motion. &quot;Likewise, the evidence already presented in this case makes clear that Commissioner Jefferson Dunn has also done little to nothing to rectify the problems.&quot; Maria Morris, senior supervising attorney for the Southern Poverty Law Center, said the Alabama Department of Corrections has already begun improving observation for suicidal inmates. But several other problems still exist. Not all the cells used to house suicidal inmates are safe, according to reports filed by the department of corrections. According to the motion, Wallace did not receive counseling while on suicide watch or in the two days following his release. Wallace, who went to prison at age 18, was placed on suicide watch about 60 times during his five years in prison. Morris said other inmates have said they received no counseling on suicide watch. &quot;They said they are placed in a suicide cell,&quot; Morris said. &quot;Every so often, someone comes by and asks if they are still suicidal and when they aren&#x27;t, they let them out. And that&#x27;s it.&quot; Wallace said he suffered from schizophrenia, bi-polar disorder, ADHD and low IQ. A prison psychologist recommended that Wallace be transferred to Taylor-Hardin Secure Medical Facility, a mental hospital for patients who have committed crimes. Bob Horton, spokesman for the Alabama Department of Corrections, said the department could not comment on Wallace&#x27;s death because an investigation is ongoing. He said the department is aware of the motion and will wait for a ruling. During his testimony on Dec. 5, Wallace became agitated and had to be removed from court. U.S. District Judge Myron Thompson asked attorneys from both sides to arrange an independent evaluation for Wallace, but it didn&#x27;t occur before his death.",

On CNN&#x27;s &quot;State of the Union,&quot; McCain told host Jake Tapper that there was &quot;no doubt&quot; Russia interfered with the election. &quot;We need to get to the bottom of this,&quot; he said. &quot;There&#x27;s no doubt they were interfering. There&#x27;s no doubt. The question is now, how much and what damage? And what should the United States of America do?&quot; Earlier this month, the CIA concluded in a secret assessment that Russia meddled in the election to help Donald Trump win the presidency. FBI Director James B. Comey and Director of National Intelligence James R. Clapper Jr. agreed with the CIA&#x27;s assessment. Tapper asked whether McCain was concerned that Trump has not denounced Russia&#x27;s alleged interference - while maintaining a &quot;friendly posture&quot; toward Russian President Vladimir Putin. McCain, who has at times been a vocal critic of Trump, on Sunday seemed to avoid directly finding fault with the president-elect&#x27;s approach to Russia. &quot;No, I have not heard (Trump) criticize Putin,&quot; McCain told Tapper. &quot;I think reality is going to intercede at one point or another just because of the Russian activities. I hope that with people like (retired Marine Gen. James Mattis and others) that he will very quickly understand what the Russians are all about.&quot; Last week, Hillary Clinton, in audio obtained by the New York Times, partly blamed her loss on &quot;the unprecedented Russian plot to swing this election.&quot; &quot;And this is something every American should be worried about,&quot; Clinton told campaign donors Thursday night. &quot;You know, we have to recognize that, as the latest reports made clear, Vladimir Putin himself directed the covert cyber attacks against our electoral system, against our democracy, apparently because he has a personal beef against me.&quot; When Tapper played that portion of audio for McCain on his show, the senator said that he had seen no evidence that the election outcome would have changed - but that it didn&#x27;t matter. &quot;I have seen no evidence that the voting machines were tampered with,&quot; McCain said. &quot;I have seen no evidence that the election would have been different, but that doesn&#x27;t change the fact that the Russians and others - the Chinese, to a lesser degree - have been able to interfere with our electoral process.&quot; McCain said, &quot;If they are able to harm the electoral process, then they destroy democracy.&quot; A select, bipartisan committee would focus not only on Russia&#x27;s alleged activities during the 2016 campaign but also cyberattacks in general, the senator said. He said the issue of cybersecurity is &quot;spread out over about four different committees in the Senate.&quot; McCain, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, was one of four senators who earlier this month called for a thorough investigation of alleged Russian influence in the U.S. election. He joined Sen. Lindsey O. Graham, R-S.C., incoming Senate Democratic leader Charles E. Schumer, N.Y., and Armed Services ranking Democrat Jack Reed, R.I., in issuing a statement. &quot;This cannot become a partisan issue,&quot; the statement read in part. &quot;The stakes are too high for our country. We are committed to working in this bipartisan manner, and we will seek to unify our colleagues around the goal of investigating and stopping the grave threats that cyberattacks conducted by foreign governments pose to our national security.&quot; (c) 2016, The Washington Post.

      "full": "Dr. Henry Heimlich FILE - In this Feb. 5, 2014, file photo, Dr. Henry Heimlich holds his memoir prior to being interviewed at his home in Cincinnati. Heimlich, the surgeon who created the life-saving Heimlich maneuver for choking victims has died Saturday, Dec. 17, 2016, at Christ Hospital in Cincinnati. He was 96. (AP Photo/Al Behrman, File) Henry J. Heimlich, the Cincinnati surgeon whose &quot;bear-hug&quot; maneuver has been credited with saving the lives of tens of thousands of choking victims but whose aggressive self-promotion and unorthodox medical ideas cast a shadow over his legacy, died Dec. 17 at a Cincinnati hospital. He was 96.<br/><br/>He had a heart attack, said a son, Phil Heimlich.<br/><br/>In a career spanning seven decades, Henry Heimlich zealously promoted lifesaving procedures and techniques he invented or refined. Besides the first-aid rescue maneuver introduced in 1974, these advances included a now-common surgical procedure he helped develop in the 1950s for people with severe esophageal damage and a valve for chest drainage that was widely used during field surgery in the Vietnam War and in emergency facilities. <a data-enhanced=\"small\" href=\"http://www.pennlive.com/nation-world/2016/05/dr_heimlich_96_uses_his_maneuv.html\" target=\"_blank\"></a><br/><br/>Heimlich was a charismatic speaker with unshakable faith in his abilities. He repeatedly circumvented established practices such as publishing in peer-reviewed journals, and he presented himself as a medical David fighting an establishment Goliath when confronting skeptics.<br/><br/>And opposition was not unusual.<br/><br/>His attempts to make the Heimlich maneuver the chief or sole response in choking and drowning situations encountered resistance, and his later efforts to use malariotherapy - exposure to malaria - to treat illnesses including AIDS, cancer and Lyme disease were fiercely criticized.<br/><br/>&quot;It&#x27;s the pattern,&quot; he told The Washington Post in 1989. &quot;First, they say it won&#x27;t work, then when it proves to work, they say it&#x27;s nothing new. Most people cannot accept some guy coming in who&#x27;s not totally involved in the politics of the field, coming up with an idea that they haven&#x27;t figured out in 50 years.&quot;<br/><br/>He was colorful and combative when defending his most enduring contribution to medicine, the &quot;bear hug&quot; that became known as the Heimlich maneuver. In his public speaking engagements and sundry television appearances, Heimlich often selected the most attractive woman he could find in the audience to demonstrate the maneuver.<br/><br/>The slightly risque nature of his showmanship led to appearances on Johnny Carson&#x27;s &quot;Tonight Show.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Listen, Johnny,&quot; Heimlich quipped, &quot;if I can do this maneuver on a human, I can do it on you.&quot;<br/><br/>Ronald Reagan, on the campaign trail in 1976, New York Mayor Edward I. Koch and actresses Marlene Dietrich and Elizabeth Taylor were reputed beneficiaries of the Heimlich maneuver. But the degree to which it entered the public consciousness did little to end his battle with medical associations that gave only qualified support to the Heimlich.<br/><br/>His research relied too much on anecdotal evidence and too little on quantitative data to persuade the American Red Cross, the National Academy of Sciences and the American Heart Association. &quot;You can&#x27;t establish scientific truth with a popular vote,&quot; Don M. Benson, then-anesthesiology chairman at Aultman Hospital in Canton, Ohio, told the Wall Street Journal in 1979.<br/><br/>In 1986, the American Red Cross recognized the Heimlich maneuver as a useful rescue technique in choking incidents. But the organization would not endorse it as the primary response in drowning cases, and Heimlich wrote the organization&#x27;s leaders, essentially accusing them of letting people die while they dawdled on research and bureaucracy.<br/><br/>By training, Heimlich was a thoracic surgeon, or a specialist in chest surgery. When he began developing the Heimlich, in 1973, he was the chief of surgery at the Jewish Hospital of Cincinnati.<br/><br/>Although the backslap was a common response to choking at the time, it sometimes caused an object to become lodged deeper in a victim&#x27;s throat. (Heimlich dismissed backslaps as &quot;death blows.&quot;) And physician-inventors had proposed gadgets such as the &quot;Throat-E-Vac&quot; (a vacuum device) and the &quot;ChokeSaver&quot; (nine-inch-long tweezers) without much success.<br/><br/>Heimlich knew that air remained in the lungs after an exhalation. That air, he believed, could be used to expel an object. He experimented on an anesthetized beagle and eventually realized that with an upward thrust into the soft tissue under the diaphragm, an object could be dislodged from the throat.<br/><br/>The maneuver is elementary, as the doctor wanted it to be. The rescuer stands behind the choking victim, with the rescuer&#x27;s arms around the victim&#x27;s waist and then delivers a sharp, upward abdominal thrust, just above the belly button.<br/><br/>He wrote about the first-aid technique in the June 1974 issue of Emergency Medicine. He explained how the maneuver worked and urged readers to send him success stories. He sent the article to science and health writers in the mainstream media and said that more than 2,000 stories of being saved by the maneuver came back within a year.<br/><br/> Heimlich parlayed that early publicity into popular support for his anti-choking technique. In 1984, he received the prestigious Lasker Award for public service. The next year, then-Surgeon General C. Everett Koop, who said he once performed the maneuver on a grandson, called the Heimlich maneuver &quot;the only method that should be used for the treatment of choking from foreign body airway obstruction.&quot;<br/><br/>In 1986, Koop&#x27;s pressure led the American Red Cross and American Heart Association to recognize the Heimlich maneuver as a useful rescue technique in choking. But the Red Cross also recommended that the Heimlich maneuver be used on drowning victims only if mouth-to-mouth resuscitation failed because of a &quot;solid body&quot; airway obstruction. Water in the airway is not considered a solid body obstruction. Henry Jay Heimlich was born Feb. 3, 1920, in Wilmington, Del., and raised in New Rochelle, N.Y. He often accompanied his father, a social worker, on his rounds of New York state prisons. After graduating from Cornell University in 1941 and its medical school in 1943, Henry Heimlich served as a Navy surgeon during World War II. He said he was the only doctor assigned to a Marine unit helping Chinese allies in the Gobi Desert in Mongolia, and he often operated in a field hospital without electricity. In 1951, he married Jane Murray, the daughter of dance studio personalities Arthur and Kathryn Murray. His wife died in 2012. Around the time of his marriage, Heimlich began working as a thoracic surgeon at New York City hospitals. He devoted his spare time to developing new medical devices and techniques. On a napkin, he sketched an idea for using a section of a patient&#x27;s stomach to construct a new esophagus to treat esophageal damage caused, for instance, by cancer or the ingestion of a caustic chemical. The idea got the brushoff from several hospital executives, but he eventually secured a $300 grant and laboratory space and tested the procedure on dogs. He published his findings in the journal Surgery in 1955, and two years later, he successfully performed the operation on a human. Heimlich, for years, was credited as a prime developer of this &quot;reversed gastric tube&quot; procedure, which became standard in operating rooms. In later decades, a dispute arose over whether Heimlich had purposely underplayed the contribution of a Romanian surgeon who performed the procedure on a person before he did. That doctor, Dan Gavriliu, called Heimlich a &quot;liar and thief&quot; when the Cincinnati Enquirer contacted him in 2003 for an investigative story about Heimlich&#x27;s career. Beyond dispute, however, was Heimlich&#x27;s role in popularizing the procedure. The newspaper&#x27;s investigation found that Heimlich credited Gavriliu in a 1957 Surgery article but in later years gradually diminished Gavriliu&#x27;s role. In the 1960s, Heimlich introduced a simple valve to drain severe chest wounds. He said he was motivated by his memory of the primitive conditions he worked under in Mongolia. He fashioned a prototype using a toy noisemaker, which functioned as a one-way flutter valve when attached to a drainage bottle. Decades later, he said that he started a company to manufacture the valves in 1964 and that a doctor from a Navy medical research agency helped promote the device for use in Vietnam. <br/>Both innovations - the reversed gastric tube and the chest valve - were variations of existing procedures, said Thomas Schlich, a medical historian at McGill University in Montreal.<br/><br/>Schlich said of the esophageal operation: &quot;I don&#x27;t see that it had a great impact, nor was it really original.&quot; The same is true of the chest valve; Schlich said Dr. Heimlich altered a device that already existed.<br/><br/>In the mid-1980s, Heimlich began experimenting with malariotherapy, in which a patient is intentionally given malaria in the hope that the high fevers caused by the disease will cure or relieve another infection. An Austrian psychiatrist, Julius Wagner-Jauregg, won a Nobel Prize in 1927 for malariotherapy of neurosyphilis. The usefulness of the strategy, however, has never been proved.<br/><br/>Heimlich believed that malariotherapy could treat HIV infection, among other illnesses. He took his clinical trials to Mexico and China before bowing to pressure and shutting down the project.<br/><br/>&quot;He was grasping at straws and continued to push these ideas for so long,&quot; said Paul Roepe, a malaria scientist at Georgetown University. &quot;If something is not a legitimate proposal in the eyes of the broad medical community, then you don&#x27;t get funding, and that&#x27;s why he took it abroad.&quot;<br/><br/>A group of scientists and doctors from the United States and Mexico had petitioned against the HIV project, which was funded by a group of Hollywood supporters including actresses Amy Irving and Estelle Getty, the New Republic reported.<br/><br/>&quot;This exploits the AIDS crisis, exploits the generous and caring entertainment community, and it exploits the good that Heimlich himself has done in the past,&quot; said Paul Bronston, national ethics chairman of the American College of Medical Quality and a petition supporter.<br/><br/>The doctor&#x27;s most vehement adversary was his estranged son, Peter, a fabric importer who had a website devoted to attacking his father. For more than a decade, he contacted hundreds of reporters (sometimes using pseudonyms) to denounce his father as a fraud who promoted dangerous medical treatments.<br/><br/>Heimlich largely remained silent on the matter of his son&#x27;s attacks. His three other children stood by their father and defended his work and character. A complete list of survivors was not immediately available.<br/><br/>After his contract at the Jewish Hospital of Cincinnati was not renewed in 1977, Heimlich spent about a decade as an advanced clinical professor at Cincinnati&#x27;s Xavier University. He remained through recent years the chief evangelist of the Heimlich maneuver and his own legacy.<br/><br/>This May, he received a flurry of attention for performing the Heimlich on an 87-year-old woman choking on a piece of meat at their senior residence in Cincinnati. Heimlich said it was the first time he had used the maneuver in an emergency, an assertion apparently contradicted by statements made to media outlets in the early 2000s.

      "full": "A long-running billing dispute between Medicare and Huntsville&#x27;s Alabama Pain Center reached another impasse last month, disrupting care for thousands of patients using powerful painkillers for the treatment of chronic pain. Last month, the clinic sent a letter to patients covered by Medicare and Medicaid, urging them to seek care elsewhere. Alabama Pain Center, which had not been receiving payment from Medicare for more than a year, can now no longer bill the program, according to the letter. Alabama Pain Center is the latest of several pain clinics in the state forced to close or curtail services due to action by federal or state authorities, a development alarming to patients prescribed high doses of powerful painkillers. Patients who use opioids and other controlled substances for long periods of time risk becoming dependent on the drugs, and can suffer agonizing withdrawal when the medication runs out. Experts worry that some of these patients may turn to heroin. Pat Brunker of Meridianville received her first pain pump from Dr. K. Dean Willis, chief medical officer of Alabama Pain Center, in 2005 after she exhausted surgical options for severe back pain. She recently got a replacement pump and visits the clinic for drug refills once a month. &quot;It&#x27;s the best thing that ever happened to me,&quot; Brunker said. &quot;My fear, because of this terrible activity, is that he will go out of business. If he does, I don&#x27;t know where the hell I&#x27;m going to go.&quot; The number of Alabama Board of Medical Examiners investigations related to prescribing practices in Alabama increased from 7 in 2012 to 44 last year. In Huntsville in 2013, state and federal authorities cracked down on Dr. Shelinder Aggarwal. Last year, agents from the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency arrested two doctors, John Patrick Couch and Xiulu Ruan, affiliated with a large pain practice in Mobile. Many physicians shy away from taking on patients from closed clinics who use high doses of pain medication - fearing possible sanction for excessive prescribing. Sheila Rogers of Grant suffered through seven days of withdrawal after Aggarwal lost his controlled substance certificate while under investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice and state medical board. He eventually pleaded guilty to Medicare fraud. Rogers took high doses of painkillers to subdue neck pain that worsened after unsuccessful surgery. For months after her last operation, she slept upright in an armchair. &quot;It took me eight months until I could even lay down in the bed,&quot; she said. Her primary care physician referred her to Aggarwal. She initially resisted Aggarwal&#x27;s suggestion to try methadone, but eventually gave in and combined the long-acting opioid with oxycodone to control her pain. Rogers said she never abused the drugs or sold them. The drugs muted her pain enough to help her care for a nephew with Down syndrome and her own teenage son. After more than two years of treatment, Aggarwal closed his office with no warning, she said. Earlier this year, he pleaded guilty to fraud and illegally prescribing controlled substances. Prosecutors said he wrote more than 100,000 prescriptions, an average of more than 400 a day. Medicare data showed that he billed the program more for some controlled substances than almost any other doctor in the country. Aggarwal operated a pill mill, but Rogers came to rely on his care. Like almost all long-term opioid users, she became physically dependent on her medication. When Aggarwal closed and she ran out of medication, she went to a friend&#x27;s house so her children wouldn&#x27;t see her suffer. &quot;When they shut down Dr. Aggarwal, it was horrible,&quot; she said. &quot;When you are coming off of methadone, the pain comes from your bones. You talk about painful - it was painful.&quot; After she went through withdrawal, Rogers&#x27; pain sent her back to another pain specialist, Dr. Mark Murphy in Madison. He plans to retire at the end of the year, according to an employee at his office. The same employee said the doctor put a plan in place to transfer care to different practitioners. The Alabama Board of Medical Examiners has filed a complaint against Murphy and scheduled a hearing for March, according to documents available online, although details of the allegations are unavailable. ProPublica, a nonprofit investigative journalism organization, identified Murphy as a top prescriber of 10 different controlled substances in 2014. Rogers has been seeing Murphy for more than two years, and she said he has drastically reduced her dose of pain medication. She said she doesn&#x27;t feel as good as she did under Aggarwal&#x27;s care, but she is happy with Murphy&#x27;s treatment. She worries that there might be fallout when north Alabama loses another pain practitioner.",

The new year brings new four-year terms for Gov. Kay Ivey and a Legislature with newcomers holding 42 of the 140 seats. Most of the problems and challenges they face will not be new. <i>Joe Songer | jsonger@al.com</i> Gov. Kay Ivey, shown here after winning the Republican nomination in June, begins a new four-year term on Jan. 14. <i>Chuck Crow/The Plain Dealer</i> <b>Gasoline tax</b> Ivey and the leaders of the Republican-controlled Alabama Legislature say a high priority for 2019 is more funding to maintain, improve and expand the state&#x27;s roads and bridges. Ivey said she is working with House Speaker Mac McCutcheon and Senate President Pro Tem Del Marsh on a plan. The Legislature last raised the gasoline tax in 1992, adding 5 cents a gallon. Advocates for an increase say the total state tax of 18 cents a gallon has not kept pace with the rising cost of sustaining a sufficient highway system. That argument was not enough to convince rank and file members to support gas tax bills that failed in 2016 and 2017. <i>Bob Gathany/AL.com</i> <b>Senate seat scramble</b> The consequences of Jeff Sessions&#x27; appointment as U.S. attorney general continue to ripple through Alabama politics. Republicans are confident they can reclaim Sessions&#x27; former Senate seat from Democrat Doug Jones, who won it in a special election in 2017. The election is in 2020, but the race will likely start next year. U.S. Rep. Bradley Byrne of Mobile, Sen. President Pro Tem Del Marsh and State Auditor Jim Zeigler have said they are considering the race. Speculators have mentioned a number of other high-profile Republicans as potential candidates. Sessions has not announced his plans since resigning as attorney general in November. Jones is running to keep the seat. <i>Julie Bennett/AL.com</i> <b>Grappling with prison problems</b> Alabama lawmakers boosted funding for prisons this year. Sentencing reforms have slowly reduced the number of prisoners. But prisons remain above capacity and the remaining inmate population has a higher proportion of violent offenders, contributing to rising violence in prisons with a serious shortage of correctional officers. The Ivey administration has hired companies to assess needs for new prisons and renovations. The state must expand and improve mental health care for prisoners or face uncertain consequences in an ongoing federal lawsuit. <i>Marvin Fong/The Plain Dealer</i> <b>Lottery and sports betting</b> Alabama lawmakers introduce lottery bills every year but most years the proposals receive little attention. A lottery bill backed by Gov. Robert Bentley did come close to passing in 2016 but unraveled because of disagreements on how narrowly to define a lottery. House and Senate leaders are not leading the charge for a lottery in 2019 and Ivey is not an advocate, though she says she is not opposed to a vote on a constitutional amendment. But with Alabama now surrounded by lottery states and with a U.S. Supreme Court ruling in May opening the chance for states to legalize sports betting, the profile of gambling legislation could rise in 2019. The photo shows customers in Brook Park, Ohio in line to buy Mega Millions lottery tickets in October. <i>Mike Stocker/South Florida Sun-Sentinel/Associated Press</i> <b>School safety</b> The mass shooting that claimed 17 lives at a Florida high school on Valentine&#x27;s Day prompted a variety of school safety proposals that failed to make it through the Alabama Legislature in 2018, ranging from arming teachers to raising minimum ages on gun purchases. Gov. Kay Ivey appointed a panel that made 10 recommendations including more school resource officers, making school buildings more secure and expanding access to mental health services for troubled students. All would require additional funding. House Speaker Mac McCutcheon said he expects school security to be a central issue in the 2019 session. McCutcheon appointed an advisory panel with professionals in education, law enforcement and mental health to help sort out the merits of what legislators propose.

Thankfully, that’s easy to do. There are plenty of ways to track Santa using the latest in modern technology. <b>NORAD</b> The North American Aerospace Defense Command is celebrating the 63rd anniversary of tracking Santa&#x27;s yuletide journey. The NORAD Tracks Santa website, www.noradsanta.org, launched Dec. 1, features Santa&#x27;s North Pole Village, which includes a holiday countdown, games, activities, and more. NORAD depends on thousands of volunteers to make its yearly Santa tracking possible. The tradition began in 1955 after a Colorado Springs-based Sears & Roebuck & Co. advertisement misprinted the telephone number for children to call Santa. Instead of reaching Santa, the phone number put kids through to the CONAD Commander-in-Chief&#x27;s operations &quot;hotline.&quot; The Director of Operations at the time, Colonel Harry Shoup, had his staff check the radar for indications of Santa making his way south from the North Pole. Children who called were given updates on his location, and a tradition was born. In 1958, the governments of Canada and the United States created a bi-national air defense command for North America called the North American Aerospace Defense Command, also known as NORAD, which then took on the tradition of tracking Santa. NORAD&#x27;s tracking starts Dec. 24 at 2:01 a.m. when website visitors can watch Santa make preparations for his flight. At 6 a.m. EST, trackers worldwide can speak with a live phone operator to inquire as to Santa&#x27;s whereabouts by dialing the toll-free number 1-877-Hi-NORAD (1-877-446-6723) or by sending an email to noradtrackssanta@outlook.com. You can see the latest going on in the North Pole here. <b>Amazon Alexa, OnStar</b> Any time on Dec. 24, Amazon Alexa users can ask for Santa&#x27;s location through the NORAD Tracks Santa skill for Amazon Alexa, and OnStar subscribers can press the OnStar button in their vehicles to locate Santa. Bing and Cortana users can also find Santa&#x27;s location on Dec. 24. <b>Google tracks Santa</b> Google Earth is also tracking Santa. The tracker will go live Dec. 24 and is available available online as well as in the Android App and on Chromecast.

When it comes to who leads those schools---the principals---the split between men and women is about equal. But principals at the highest grade levels and largest schools are men more often than not. Take it one step higher, to the superintendent&#x27;s office, and females are far under-represented in Alabama&#x27;s school districts. And what about boards of education? Women are still under-represented on boards of education, but are closer to parity than at the superintendent level. Read on to see AL.com&#x27;s breakdown of who is running Alabama&#x27;s schools. Teachers Alabama is not unlike most states in that the vast majority---more than 79 percent---of teachers are female. According to the National Center for Education Statistics, during the 2015-16 school year, the most recent year data is available, 76.6 percent of teachers across the country were female. The state-level data was obtained from the Alabama State Department of Education and reflects the 2016-17 school year, the most recent year for which data is available. Principals There is more gender parity at the principal level, looking at all grade levels combined. Just more than half of school principals in Alabama&#x27;s public schools are female. Parity in pay doesn&#x27;t seem to be an issue at the principal level, looking across all grade levels. Female principals&#x27; median pay for the 2017-18 school year was $87,005, while the median pay for 2017-18 for male principals was $89,122. Salary data came from the Alabama State Department of Education and does not include benefits. Related: How much do Alabama&#x27;s public school principals get paid? Principals and their pay - nationwide Across the country, according to 2017 data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, principals earned an average of $97,640. This data includes all principals at the elementary, middle and high school level in both public and private schools. The national data shows Alabama principals earned an average of $81,500, but that includes public and private schools. Data from the Alabama State Department of Education shows the average public school principal salary statewide is $88,817 for the 2017-18 school year. The average teacher salary was $49,987 for the same time period. Principals by grade levels served Though the number of female and male principals across all grade levels is nearly even, females are more likely to be a principal in a school with lower grade levels than males.

Principals by school enrollment There are about the same number of female and male principals at schools that enroll fewer than 1,000 students.

      "full": "The mass shooting at a Parkland, Florida, high school — which killed 17 students and staff, and sparked nationwide student-led marches for gun control — was the top news story of 2018, according to The Associated Press&#x27; annual poll of U.S. editors and news directors. The No. 2 story was the investigation by special counsel Robert Mueller into whether Donald Trump&#x27;s election campaign coordinated with Russia. It was one of several major stories — in a year jam-packed with dramatic developments — in which the U.S. president played a role. A year ago, the surge of #MeToo sexual misconduct allegations that toppled many powerful men was voted the top news story of 2017. The continuing momentum of #MeToo in 2018 was this year&#x27;s No. 3 story. The first AP top-stories poll was conducted in 1936, when editors chose the abdication of Britain&#x27;s King Edward VIII. Here are 2018&#x27;s top 10 stories, in order: In this Wednesday, Feb. 14, 2018 file photo, students from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., hold their hands in the air as they are evacuated by police after a shooter opened fire on the campus. <b> 1. Parkland school shooting</b> It happened on Valentine&#x27;s Day — an act of senseless hate by a gunman with a semi-automatic rifle who killed 15 students and two staff members at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. Previous mass shootings had prompted passionate calls for tighter gun-control laws, but this time was different. A group of student survivors at the school, soon joined by allies nationwide, launched the March for Our Lives movement that organized massive walkouts and peaceful protests at schools across the country. The movement remains active, and has helped energize the broader campaign for tougher gun laws. In this Monday, July 16, 2018 file photo, U.S. President Donald Trump, left, and Russian President Vladimir Putin, right, shake hand at the beginning of a meeting at the Presidential Palace in Helsinki, Finland.

The shooting incident happened just after 5:30 p.m. in the 2400 block of Fifth Street N.W. Jefferson County sheriff’s Chief Deputy Randy Christian said deputies responded to the location on a shooting complaint. It was reported that shots had been fired from two cars at a group of four men who had been standing outside the residence, he said. Homes and cars were struck by gunfire, but no one was injured. The victims told deputies that they had been outside when two vehicles drove slowly down the street. The occupants of the vehicles began shooting at them. They also reported that they knew the suspects and had been in a previous altercation with them. The victims provided the names of the suspects and a description of the vehicles. The suspect and vehicle descriptions were broadcast to deputies who patrol the Center Point area. On Wednesday, a deputy on patrol spotted one of the vehicles at an apartment complex and conducted a traffic stop. The passenger in the car was found to be in possession of a handgun that had been reported as stolen to the Huntsville Police Department. Both the driver and passenger were taken to the Center Point substation to be questioned by detectives. Investigators learned the driver of the car had not been involved in the shooting and had no knowledge of it. He was released. The passenger admitted to taking part in the shooting by driving one of the cars involved. He was arrested and taken to the Jefferson County Jail to await formal charges of attempted murder. His name is withheld pending formal charges. The investigation is ongoing and additional arrests and charges are expected. “It’s beyond disturbing how some of our young people put so little value on life, including their own,’’ Christian said. “This was outstanding work by our patrol and detective personnel working closely with the Metro Area Crime Center.” If you purchase a product or register for an account through a link on our site, we may receive compensation.

      "full": "University of North Alabama professor Greg Gaston was found in violation of Title IX for sexual harassment and was subsequently fired. At least three women contacted UNA’s Title IX office to report Gaston for inappropriate behavior. Gaston was placed on a no trespass order on June 22, 2018, dependent on the results of the Title IX investigation, that barred him from UNA’s campus and university-sponsored events. Payton Gilchrist was the first to file a complaint against Gaston in June 2018. Gilchrist said Gaston was known for making inappropriate comments during class, but crossed a line when he asked her to take a vacation with him. Gilchrist declined, but Gaston continued to pursue a romantic relationship with her. “[Gaston] would make sexist comments in class, he would show favoritism toward females. There were a lot of behaviors of Dr. Gaston that was inappropriate that people would brush off,” Gilchirst said in an interview with AL.com.

Amanda Gallagher, who graduated from UNA in 2013, was one of them. “Immediately I knew what [the no trespass order] had been about because of my and my friends experiences,” Gallagher said. Gallagher said Gaston had commented on the size of her breasts and touched her inappropriately when she was a student at UNA. “I was standing in the hallway of the geology department talking to a friend and he walked by and he rubbed his hand across my ass,”Gallagher said. “I stopped talking and he looked at me and he said he was feeling for a panty line.” The Title IX investigation took six months, in part, Gilchrist said, because of the women who continued to come forward.",

      "next_sentence_true": "Many people concerned about Dauphin Island maintain that the ship channel cuts off a natural westward flow of replenishing sand along the coast, starving the island&#x27;s shoreline of sand needed to counteract the impact of waves and storms.",
      "full": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has committed $4 million to putting sand from channel dredging work into an area where it could help feed the eroding beaches of Dauphin Island. Dauphin Island Mayor Jeff Collier said that while the move wasn&#x27;t a magic cure-all for the health of the barrier island&#x27;s fragile shores, it definitely was a step in the right direction. &quot;Certainly an effort like this is something we&#x27;ve been pushing for, calling for, for a number of years,&quot; he said. Collier said he&#x27;d gotten a call earlier this week from U.S. Rep. Bradley Byrne, who said such a project had been a priority for himself and Sen. Richard Shelby. Byrne said on social media that the funding &quot;will help support the restoration and long-term stability&quot; of the island. On Wednesday, Corps officials provided some additional detail after the news was announced Tuesday by U.S. Rep. Bradley Byrne. In fiscal 2019, the Corps has allocated about $10 million for maintenance dredging of the Mobile Ship Channel, plus about $2 million for transport and disposal of dredge spoil. E. Patrick Robbins, legislative affairs chief for the Corps&#x27; Mobile District, said that&#x27;s a normal annual expenditure. But an additional $4 million allocation is new, he said, and so is the area where it&#x27;ll be placed. Many people concerned about Dauphin Island maintain that the ship channel cuts off a natural westward flow of replenishing sand along the coast, starving the island&#x27;s shoreline of sand needed to counteract the impact of waves and storms. They&#x27;ve argued for years that because the Corps maintains the channel it&#x27;s part of the problem and should take proactive measures to compensate. The Corps already had established a zone called the Sand Island Beneficial Use Area (SIBUA), where sand from dredge work could be placed in the hope that it would make its way to the beach. Results haven&#x27;t been impressive, and island advocates such as Collier have argued that the sand needs to be put in shallower water closer to the island. The debate has risen again as the Corps has considered a plan to deepen the ship channel. The Corps has proposed, and gotten approval for, an expansion of the SIBUA. That means the sand being moved with this $4 million allocation might do more good. &quot;This is a positive step,&quot; said Collier. &quot;This is a good move.&quot; Some big questions remain unanswered. Robbins said that contracts for the work haven&#x27;t yet been developed, so it&#x27;s not clear exactly when the work will start, how long it will last or how much sand will be moved into the SIBUA. He speculated that contracts could be executed in summer 2019, allowing work to begin. &quot;We think it&#x27;s going to be a positive for everybody,&quot; he said. After that, observers will wait to see if the sand actually goes where it&#x27;s needed. Collier said one issue he&#x27;s curious about is whether the Corps plans &quot;any follow-up to make that determination.&quot; Another big question: If putting sand in the expanded SIBUA does indeed help replenish the island&#x27;s beaches, will more such work be incorporated into the ship channel enlargement project? Collier said he’d like to see that, because he thinks an occasional shot of sand isn’t a long-term fix. He’d like for such handling of dredge spoil “to be incorporated as part of the normal maintenance of the ship channel,” he said.

Jamarkus Holifield, 19, whose bond is currently $150,000 with a $15,000 cash component, is accused of killing 15-year-old Anesa Baker and injuring others after he allegedly shot at crowds of people at the Grand Hall event space during an Easter weekend show. Holifield, who has been in Mobile County Jail since May of this year, sent the letter to District Judge Bob Sherling Dec. 7 asking him to reduce his bond as per the Alabama Constitution and in accordance with similar actions taken in other cases. Holifield’s basic point in the letter, which is available in court filings, is that the bond figure inhibits his ability to make bail and therefore he is doing jail time for a crime he has not yet been convicted or even tried for. The letter was sent from Mobile County Jail. In response to the letter, Judge Sherling noted that Holifield has the right to represent himself or be represented by an attorney, not both. Holifield has an attorney. “The court has not read the Defendant’s letter in this case,” wrote Judge Sherling. “The letter is to be forwarded to his or her attorney, for the further action as the attorney, in consultation with the client, deems appropriate. If the attorney needs to be re-appointed to this case to be paid for services, this Order re-appoints the attorney to the case.” Holifield is currently being represented by Diane McGowin, according to court records. AL.com attempted to reach McGowin for comment but she was unavailable.

Of the five shooting victims, one person&#x27;s injury was self-inflicted and Baker was killed, according to Mobile Police Chief Lawrence Baptiste, who spoke at a press conference the day after. He said the self-inflicted wound was likely an accident and that at least one of the two people that was trampled suffered broken bones. Police arrived at the scene at around 11 p.m., where they describe seeing approximately 300 teenagers between the ages of 15 to 18 year-old. It’s believed that most of the victims took themselves to hospital, but Chief Baptiste said some ambulances were at the scene. Chief Baptiste acknowledged that the spring break timing may have been a factor since children in Mobile would have been off Monday. &quot;This is a plea to the parents, said Baptiste at the time. &quot;To be more vigilant where their children are hanging out at, to be sure they are going into a safe environment, that those establishments have safety protocols in place, to make sure of their children&#x27;s safety.&quot; &quot;Most of all hold children accountable for their actions, because the life that they save might just be their own children.&quot; The parking lot was strewn with mostly garbage, but evidence of the rush to escape the hall was clear.

Two were officers at the Ventress Correctional Facility in Clayton. The third was a correctional officer trainee at the William E. Donaldson Correctional Facility in Bessemer. On Monday, agents with the ADOC Investigations and Intelligence Division arrested the two Ventress officers. Authorities identified them as Tiffany Grey, 25, of Clayton, and Tawanda Rhymes, 35, of Eufaula. Both are charged with use of office for personal gain and failure of duty after an internal investigation found that they had been soliciting contraband to inmates for money. In a separate arrest on Tuesday, 35-year-old Tomisha Hyman of Center Point was charged with use of office for personal again. Officials said Hyman had received multiple payments from inmates in exchange for contraband. Grey and Hyman resigned from their job following their arrests. Rhymes was placed on mandatory leave pending dismissal procedures. Rhymes had been with the ADOC since 2010. Grey joined the department in 2015, and Hyman had been a correctional officer trainee since 2017. ADOC Commissioner Jeff Dunn said the department has taken significant steps to eliminate corruption. “In the past four years, we have fully staffed the department’s investigations and intelligence division in a deliberate approach to eliminate corruption and to mitigate criminal activity inside our correctional facilities,’’ Dunn said. “The small percentage of those who choose to use their position for personal gain does not accurately represent the majority of our professional workforce that is committed to upholding the public’s trust by adhering to the highest standards that is expected of a law enforcement agency.”",

The pageant will air tonight at 7 p.m. ET on Fox. The 24-year-old Omaha, Nebraska native is a former Miss Nebraska Teen USA 2012 and Miss Nebraska USA 2018. Summers was the first woman from Nebraska to win the Miss USA crown and the 11th former Miss Teen USA to win the title. Summers is a graduate of Texas Christian University, earning degrees in child development and strategic communication. Prior to winning the Miss USA crown, Summers worked as a certified child life specialist. According to her Miss USA biography, Summers is “passionate about encouraging others to have a health relationship with food and fitness.” “When not busy in scrubs, she can often be found in workout gear teaching Pilates or taking a dance party cycling class. From her personal experience finding a balance, watching her mother lose 75 pounds, supporting multiple friends as they struggled with anorexia and orthorexia and learning about the eating disorder inpatient unit during her clinical rotations, she is passionate about working closely with NEDA this year and plans to continue doing so,” her biography notes. Earlier this week, Summers issued an apology after video footage was released when she appeared to make light of some of her fellow Miss Universe contestants’ failure to speak English. In the video, Summers described Miss Vietnam as “so cute,” adding she “pretends to know so much English and then you ask her a question after having a whole conversation with her and she goes …” then making a smiling face and looking confused. She later apologized via Instagram. If you purchase a product or register for an account through a link on our site, we may receive compensation.

      "full": "On a Friday afternoon in winter, the riverfront in downtown Selma feels like a ghost town trapped in time. An elegant historic hotel reminiscent of the French Quarter sits vacant, with a view of the Alabama River below. Abandoned storefronts and warehouses line the riverfront Water Avenue near the St. James Hotel and the Edmund Pettus Bridge. There are plenty of for sale signs for most of these buildings that pre-date the Civil War. Spanish moss hangs from the trees above the banks of the Alabama River, whose surface glows with the reflection of the setting sun, unrippled by boats. “In many ways, the world has left Selma behind,” said historian Karlyn Forner, author of “Why the Vote Wasn’t Enough for Selma,” published by Duke University Press in 2017. “Selma has gotten the short end of the stick.” The only sign of activity involves the decoration of Christmas trees lined along on the Riverfront Park City Walk. Businesses have volunteered to provide a tree and decorate them. “This is the cutest little town,” said Danielle Wooten, as she decorated the tree for the Wooten Law Firm. Her husband, Brandon, grew up in Selma, graduated from the University of Alabama Law School and worked at the Montgomery District Attorney’s office. The Wootens moved back to Selma in 2010, despite ominous signs of decline and poor prospects for an upwardly mobile black family. No city in Alabama with more than 10,000 people has suffered a faster population decline than Selma since then. None are even close. Selma had a population of 20,756 in 2010, according to the U.S. Census. By 2017, Census estimates said it had shrunk by 11.5 percent to 18,370. The Selma City public school system has dropped from 4,055 students in 2000 to 2,854 in 2018. “Selma does have a future,” Danielle Wooten said. “We are in a time of challenges. It is going to turn around. It depends on the community coming together.” The City of Selma has traditionally put up Christmas decorations, but after more than 60 city employees were laid off Nov. 6 due to budget shortfalls it appeared there would be no decorations this year. “Community groups banded together and said we’ll put up the decorations,” Wooten said. “They were going to do it themselves. It’s bringing people together.” Sheryl Smedley, executive director of the Selma Chamber of Commerce, said that was a misunderstanding. “The city never made a public announcement that there would be no Christmas decorations,” she said. “They were running one week behind.” The city did put up the decorations, Wooten said. “Maybe these challenges are here for a reason, to show us that we need each other,” she said. “It’s hard for some people to see the future. If the people who have the means to leave do leave, then what’s left? But what if they came back? What could happen if they came together?” Smedley said negotiations are going on for the purchase of the St. James Hotel, built in 1837, which could be re-branded as a Hilton Hotel. “With the right folks managing it, that would definitely be a shot in the arm for us,” she said. “That’s going to be a big economic boost to our downtown.” The Alabama Department of Transportation has approved a project that will expand the city’s River Walk around the hotel, connecting to the current walkway, Smedley said. That project will cost hundreds of thousands of dollars. Another phase later could add a boat dock for boat access to the St. James Hotel, she said. The renovation of the St. James Hotel could open the door to a renaissance in the opportunity zone along the river that once was home to cotton warehouses and commodity brokers. A mile away, during lunch time at Lannie’s Barbecue on Minter Avenue, a crew of heating and air-conditioning workers order their barbecue and sit down at a table. They say Lannie’s is one of the few dining options in Selma that isn’t fast food. Allen Worthy, a middle-age white man who was born in Selma and has lived here his entire life, traces the start of Selma’s economic decline to the closing of the Craig Air Force Base in 1977. “It ain’t going back to booming,” he said. “If Bush Hog and International Paper closed down, we’d dry up and blow away. We ain’t got much.” Bush Hog, with 332 employees, has been in Selma since 1952 and is known by farmers worldwide for its rotary mowers. Worthy also complained that the Selma Mall once had J.C. Penny and Sears, but now Belk and Hibbett are the main occupants in a concourse of mostly empty retail spaces. Worthy said his son works as an electrician at International Paper and his daughter attends Auburn University, so he’s not worried about them. But most young people in Selma don’t have much to hold them here, he said. “It’s not as bad as it seems,” said Anthony Collins, 30, a black man who works on the crew with Worthy. “It’s what you make it. There are other places that are worse.” Jay Wilson, an elderly black man whose grandmother started Lannie’s Barbecue 70 years ago, sits eating potato salad in a nearby booth. He thanks Worthy for his contribution to rebuild the rotted sign at Siloam Baptist Church, and gives him an update on the fundraising effort. Wilson said he knows why people are leaving Selma so fast. “Because there are no jobs for the children,” he said. When TV and movie star Oprah Winfrey came to Selma to make the movie about the city’s famous 1965 “Bloody Sunday” civil rights protests, many people hoped the movie would help transform the town. The 2014 movie “Selma,” directed by Ava DuVernay and starring the rapper Common, Winfrey and David Oyelowo as the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., brought a lot of fanfare to Selma. Wilson believes Winfrey and other millionaires still have plans for something big. “When the money comes, we’ll have a new government,” Wilson said.",

      "full": "With revelations that our cell phones are constantly tracking and sharing our location, social media is consistently manipulating the information we are given, and that screens could be quickly degrading the brains of children, it seems like there are many important questions for tech companies to answer. However, when Congress hauled the Google CEO Sundar Pichai in for a hearing recently, many lawmakers seemed to only be able to ask questions about why rude things came up when they searched their names. Should we require our lawmakers to be digitally literate? Members of the House of Representatives had the opportunity to question Google CEO Sundar Pichai about the myriad of ways the tech giant aids and manipulates modern life. Not only is the behemoth a major player in almost all aspects of modern life, the ways it functions are largely mysterious, even to those who work for the company, which leads to many concerns. Per New York Magazine: However, members of Congress seem to believe they are already well-informed about how the different internet technologies function. Rep. Lamar Smith of Texas felt confident enough in his knowledge of Google&#x27;s inner workings to argue with Pichai. Yet, that confidence seems to be misplaced. Rep. Steve King asked Pichai -- again, the CEO of Google -- why a rude message about him popped up on his granddaughter&#x27;s iPhone. Pichai reminded King he did not work for Apple. Not all members of Congress seemed confused about the way Google worked. Rep. Ted Lieu posited that &quot;if you don&#x27;t want negative search results, don&#x27;t do negative things,&quot; pointing out the inanity of complaining to the CEO of Google about negative news. Knowing the ways tech companies work is becoming increasingly important. Technology has changed faster than legislation could possibly keep up. A recent bombshell New York Times investigation revealed that our cell phones are tracking our locations and sharing that information with businesses far more than most of us could imagine.",

Clemon, in an emailed statement to AL.com Friday afternoon, said, “At the present time, I will serve as a consultant to the litigation team. That status may change with future developments in the case.” Clemon currently represents plaintiffs in a 53-year-old federal school desegregation case in Jefferson County schools and also in Hoover City Schools, which broke away from Jefferson County in 1988 but falls under the same requirements of the 1965 <i>Stout v. Jefferson County Board of Education</i> case. Clemon had been a lawyer in the Stout suit before becoming a federal judge but resumed on the case after his 2009 retirement from the bench. He also represents the plaintiff in a lawsuit alleging racial bias by Prince of Peace Catholic School in Hoover.

In July, Clarke County Judge Gaines McCorquodale refused to grant a request by the Sumter County board to keep the charter school from opening, clearing the way for the charter school’s opening in August.

They are sued in their official capacity as city officials, Ross said. LDF and Alabama voting rights attorney Jim Blacksher filed the complaint on behalf of two Pleasant Grove residents: Eric Calhoun and Jennifer Ford. The LDF first sent a letter to the city on March 22, urging the city to draw and adopt single-winner districts. “We have been having ongoing discussions with the council. The council has still not adopted new maps and they’ve had at this point nine months to take a vote or propose an alternative. That’s why we’re filing now,&quot; Ross told AL.com during a phone interview Thursday afternoon. The complaint includes three maps showing five, single-winner districts that could be adopted. LDF attorneys say the three maps both contain majority-black single-member districts and that do not place any of the current incumbents in the same single-member district. Ross said he believes there are even more options for drawing district maps that would allow black voters to elect the candidate of their choice. According to the 2010 Census, the total population of the city is 10,110 people. Of this total population, 5,427 (53.7 percent) are white and 4,534 (44.8 percent) are black. The black voting-age population of Pleasant Grove is sufficiently numerous and geographically compact to form a majority of the voting-age population in at least three single member city council districts, LDF attorneys said in the complaint. Although black candidates have run for both the office of mayor and various seats on the city council, no black candidate has ever been elected. A black woman, Priscilla McWilliams, was appointed in 2014 to replace James G. “Pete” Mosley, who vacated the Place 2 seat to move to Hoover. In the 2016 election, she ran as an incumbent for the Place 2 seat, but lost to James Crumpton, a white male. McWilliams was joined by four other black candidates in 2016 -- Audrey Rutledge Boles, Yolanda Lawson, Maria McKinney and Robert Sellers. They also lost to white candidates. Three black candidates ran unsuccessfully for mayor and city council positions in 2008. Veda Agee ran unsuccessfully for Mayor. Sherian Minor ran unsuccessfully for city council Place 4. Angela Lewis ran unsuccessfully for city council Place 2. “For far too long, Black voters in Pleasant Grove have been denied the chance to elect their preferred representatives,” said Bernard Simelton, President of the Alabama NAACP. “We are fully committed to working with the City Council to ensure that its electoral system is fair to everyone.&quot; Jon Terry of Bains and Terry Law Firm in Bessemer, which represents the city, told AL.com during a phone interview he could not comment on the lawsuit at this time.",

The agency’s map did not show the effects of the second earthquake in Alabama. Some people as far south as Trussville said on social media they felt the vibrations. On Twitter, the Tennessee Valley Authority said the quakes did not affect their operations. The USGS said a magnitude of 3.0 to 3.9, like the second earthquake, will be “felt quite noticeably,&quot; but many people do not realize the vibrations are an earthquake. A magnitude of 4.0 to 4.9 will be felt by most people indoors, because dishes and windows may rattle and walls could make a “cracking sound.” If you purchase a product or register for an account through a link on our site, we may receive compensation.

      "next_sentence_true": "Earlier this year, the federal government gave Alabama an extra $40 million through the Child Care Development Fund.",
      "full": "Alabama parents will no longer have to wait three years or more to get help paying for child care. Earlier this year, the federal government gave Alabama an extra $40 million through the Child Care Development Fund. It’s a 76 percent increase over last year. The Alabama Department of Human Resources, which oversees child care licensing and administers the grant money, has used the bulk of it to virtually eliminate the waiting list for child care subsidies to low-income families. “It used to be that you’d better get on the waiting list before you even think about having a baby,” said Joan Wright, executive director of Childcare Resources of Birmingham, a nonprofit that assists parents with finding and affording child care. She was joking, to make a point about the length of the waiting list. Now, she said, children wait just a few weeks to be approved. Alabama families who earn minimum wage or just above can qualify for a subsidy – a sum of money granted by the government – to help them afford child care. In 2016, children were waiting two or three years before their names came up. In Alabama, nearly two-thirds of all children under age 6 have all available parents in the workforce. Wright said child care should account for about 10 percent of a household’s income. But childcare in central Alabama costs an average of nearly $7,000 per year for one infant, she said, and the median income is about $46,000. “We know child care is expensive for families, and working families are spending 30 to 35 percent of their budget on childcare alone,” she said. Nearly 37,600 Alabama children receive a subsidy for child care, according to DHR. The subsidies are offered on a sliding scale, depending on the family’s income. Parents or guardians must be employed or enrolled in school to qualify, and their income must be 130 percent or less of the federal poverty level. In recent years, Alabama DHR also cut down on costs by moving to a paperless system, where parents are given a card that they swipe at the day care each day they drop off their children. The payment then goes directly to the center. “We had an issue where we weren’t sure the children were at the centers each day, so I think we saved quite a bit of money by using the cards,” said Jeanetta Green, director of childcare services for Alabama DHR. “We used to rely on the center operators to tell us which children were there (but) there was no way for us to verify whether the children attended.” The extra funding has also allowed DHR to increase the rate at which it reimburses day cares that accept subsidies. The rate ranges between $75-$156 per child per week, depending on location, age of the child and a few other factors. <b>More licensed day cares</b> The funding increase comes on the heels of new federal requirements that could change Alabama child care dramatically in the coming year. Alabama is one of a handful of states that still allow church-affiliated day care centers to be exempt from licensing. They don’t have to follow most of the inspection requirements that other day care centers must meet in order to stay open. But now, if those license-exempt centers choose to accept subsidies, they’ll have to be fully licensed by August 2019. That could change the child care landscape in Alabama, which has been tilting toward more unlicensed centers than licensed centers over the past decade. “(Recently) we’ve seen the number of licensed centers increasing, not hugely, but we’re seeing it,” said Green. “I’ve seen an 8 percent decrease in the number of license-exempt programs.” She expects the trend to continue as the August 2019 deadline looms. Last year, about half of Alabama’s roughly 1,900 child care centers claimed a religious exemption from licensing. But a series of high-profile injuries and even death in unregulated day cares has garnered media attention in recent years. Rep. Pebblin Warren, D-Tuskegee, even led a two-year legislative campaign to pass tighter regulations on child care centers. Her Child Care Safety Act was signed into law earlier this year. It added some basic requirements to unlicensed centers but stopped short of requiring them to be fully licensed. Right now, about 366 of those unlicensed centers – most of them faith-based – receive government subsidies. They’ll all have to become licensed by August or stop accepting subsidy children. About 611 licensed centers accept subsidies. Wright said she’d seen a decrease in the number of child care centers that accept subsidies. In some cases, particularly when just a handful of children at a center were on subsidies, “it wasn’t meaningful enough to the childcare program to now have to comply with these new rules and regulations, so the child care center dropped out of the (subsidy) program.” <b>Support dollars</b> In April 2018, the state spent about $7.6 million in subsidies for about 30,000 children. Alabama’s most populous counties receive the most in child care subsidy dollars, though every state receives some amount. 1. Jefferson County, $2 million in April 2018 for about 7,400 children 2. Mobile County, $1.9 million in April 2018 for about 7,300 children 3. Montgomery County, $672,000 in April 2018 for about 3,000 children 4. Madison County, $430,000 in April 2018 for about 1,500 children 5. Lee County, $276,000 in April 2018 for about 1,140 children In 2018, the federal government gave Alabama DHR nearly $135 million. The state pitched in about $16.7 million, nearly $1 million less than the year before.",

When Stimpson requested a temporary restraining order against the council on Friday, it represented something rare in Alabama politics: A city more or less suing itself.

A majority of the council had requested that Stimpson execute a new contract with Steinfels and said that if he didn&#x27;t, it would. In the complaint filed Friday, the Stimpson administration said it believed the council and Steinfels had signed such a contract, and asked for her employment to be blocked pending a ruling on the council&#x27;s authority. It turned out that while Council Vice President Levon Manzie had signed the contract, Steinfels hadn’t. In a hearing before Circuit Judge Michael Youngpeter, a truce was struck: The council won’t move forward with the contract at least until a hearing on Dec. 14, making a restraining order unnecessary. Youngpeter had expressed skepticism that a restraining order was justified, but encouraged the cease-hire.",

Perkins saw something else in that desolate place. He saw possibilities others did not. That strip of land, because of him, is now called Railroad Park. It changed the character of downtown and spurred growth. But it did way more than that. Somehow, someway, it changed the expectations of a city. It changed the way Birmingham saw itself and gave that town permission to dream bigger. That was Giles Perkins. People know what happened in Alabama last year, too. They know Doug Jones did the impossible to become a U.S. senator. Jones fitted a stone in his sling and put it between the eyes of GOP Goliath Roy Moore. When the world was watching. That was Giles Perkins too. He didn’t just help run the unlikely Jones campaign. He saw it in the beginning when others could not. He – along with Doug Turner – helped Jones buy into the vision, persuading him to run and convincing him he could win. People in Alabama knew Giles Perkins. They just don’t know. Perkins, a lawyer and strategist and former Democratic Party executive who left a mark far beyond politics, died this week at the age of 51. He had struggled for years with pancreatic cancer, making his political swansong – the Jones campaign -- all the more remarkable. He received treatments for his brutal cancer during the campaign, and knew his illness was a death sentence. But he had strength to push campaign workers, and to remind Jones to “stay in his lane,” to remain “authentic.” A win, he believed, would be a win for a fairer, more accepting world. It was important to him. If you don’t count his marriage or the birth of his children, “It probably meant more to him than anything in the world,” Sen. Jones said. Because Perkins, a Texas native who married into Alabama, saw something in the South others didn’t always see. The world looked on Alabama and the rest of this region like Birmingham looked on that strip of railroad track. It saw hate and blight and whatever might be going on the bushes. Perkins saw a different South. And he wanted Jones to help tell its story. “He believed the South can be a place of healing for this country,” Jones said. “There are new voices in the South that are changing the world. They are young, more diverse, more tolerant and respectful. We are on the cutting edge.” That’s what Perkins believed. Until the end. “At the end of the day Giles believed in the best of people,” Jones said.",

Directors Martin Weinberg, Ruby Davis, Darryl Cunningham, and Johnnye Lassiter were not in attendance. The board also voted unanimously to retain the accounting firm Warren Averett to ascertain the state of the agency’s finances. The cost will be up to $15,000. The BJCTA has been without a finance director since Gary Collins was fired last month after it was learned he pleaded guilty in November 2015 to conspiracy to file false tax returns and wire fraud with an IRS agent and agreed to give up his status as a Certified Public Account as part of the agreement, according to court records. Collins was hired on September 4, filling the void left by Karen Jacobs resignation in June. Since then, the agency has endured some financial glitches: In October, it was revealed the BJCTA had invoiced Hoover and Vestavia Hills for amounts higher than what they had previously been told would be required to service their cities—amounts they had locked into their approved budgets. Hoover was billed for $89,000 rather than $81,000; Vestavia Hills was billed $92,000 when the city had only allocated $69,000 in its FY19 budget. Then last month the agency’s 300+ employees lost medical and prescription benefits on October 1 because BJCTA missed two premium payments while continuing to deduct premiums from employee paychecks. Coverage was restored on after a check for $888,000—representing two months’ premiums—was sent to Blue Cross Blue Shield of Alabama. Warren Averett was recommended by directors LeDon Jones and Sam Parker because of their work with the Jefferson County Commission eight years ago when the county was in severe debt. “No one knew how bad it was because the [county’s financial] numbers were incorrect,” Parker said. “The firm came in and fixed it.

      "full": "Frank Martin, a veteran transportation executive and former general manager of the Birmingham-Jefferson County Transit Authority, will likely become the beleaguered agency’s next interim executive director. Martin was interviewed by the BJCTA’s board of directors at a special called Committee of the Whole Meeting on Monday morning. If he and board chair Ted Smith are able to come to a financial agreement, a resolution to retain Martin as a consultant will likely be on the agenda for the regular board meeting on Wednesday. Martin has “40 years experience in managing and directing transportation projects focusing on multidisciplinary and complex planning, administration, and operations and maintenance,” according to his bio. “He’s well respected in the industry,” says Rhona Briggins, vice president of transit services for Jacobs. “He knows transit.” Martin would replace Christopher Ruffin, who resigned from the position on Friday to return to his former role as director of operations. Ruffin, 44, joined the BJCTA as a bus driver in 2010 and rose through the ranks until being elevated to interim executive director in April when Barbara Murdock was suspended (and later fired) for allegedly using the agency credit card for personal expenses. Between May 1981 and April 1984, Martin was general manager for the BJCTA, according to his resume, after serving as assistant general manager from July 1980 to May 1981. During that period, there was a three-month shutdown of the system due to funding issues. Working with various state and local entities, and with then-mayor Richard Arrington, Martin was able to get the system running again. “We were able to restore public confidence in transit,&quot; he told the board. Subsequent to working in Birmingham, according to his resume, he held transportation leadership roles at New Orleans Regional Transit (general manager), Miami-Dade (County) Transit (assistant/deputy director of rail services), Santa Clara Valley (CA) Transportation Authority (Chief Operating Officer) and the Atkins North America’s Transportation Group Company, where he served as senior vice president, transportation and in other capacities. “My career has spanned operations initially, as well as administration.” Martin said. “I’ve mentored several young bright energetic staffs who’ve gone on to do great things.” Martin said he would be available to consult with the board for up to six months and could start in “less than two weeks”. “I understand the sense of urgency,” he said. Director Martin Weinberg asked Martin is sense of the perception of BJCTA nationwide. “Not very good, quite frankly,&quot; he said. &quot;But it’s not been the last couple of years. It’s been a couple of decades. There have been too many heads of the organization, for whatever reasons, Nationally, [the reputation’s] not very good., and that is something that really needs to be worked on. “I spent three years nine months great years here,&quot; Martin continued. “Given right person, they’ll be impressed with what’s going on here [in Birmingham]. You’ll have to make sure there’s a collective energy to work with that person, whomever he or she may be. You’ve got some work to do, in terms of external perception.&quot; Director Don Harwell asked Martin if he’s willing to tell “micro-managing&quot; board members, “You’re not my boss.” “No question,” he responded. “I come to decision having been on both sides, on operating side and serving on a board. I think it’s very important o have a distinction between policy and operations. no matter who you bring in they cannot to their job if constantly being challenged ... Even during interim phase....If you want me to be that person, I’m willing. But I’m in charge. I will not hesitate to say to board members who step out of line, &#x27;Let me handle this, I’ll report back to you about he action that should be taken. “There has to be an element of trust between board and chief executive officer.” If retained by the board on Wednesday, Martin said one of his first calls would be to the regional representative of the Federal Transportation Association (FTA) to ascertain the status of its relationship with the BJCTA. In November, the agency published an request for proposal (RFP) to retain a firm to guide its search for permanent executive director. In September 2016, Martin was inducted into the American Public Transportation Association Hall of Fame, for which he has also served on the board of directors. Martin currently lives in Clermont, FL, and is an independent consultant. Ruffin was on vacation with his wife and daughter when he learned he had been named to the interim post. Since then, he intentionally and willfully guided an embattled organization crippled by senior executive resignations, internal strife and a divided board of directors. Four senior staffers resigned during his tenure, including the finance director, interim director of human resources, head of maintenance and safety director. Last month, Ruffin fired the new finance director and chief of staff.",

      "full": "Just under two dozen protesters demonstrated for about an hour outside the AMC Patton Creek movie theater in Hoover Sunday night. Protesters said they expect to see footage by noon Monday of the Thanksgiving night shooting at the Riverchase Galleria that left two people injured by gunfire and one man, 21-year-old Emantic Fitzgerald Bradford Jr., dead after he was shot by a Hoover police officer. Protesters arrived at the theater around 7 p.m. and dispersed just after 8 p.m. Activist Carlos Chaverst Jr. called the officers “terrorists” because the officers at the mall were not wearing name badges. He also called the officers “klansmen.” Around 12 officers were standing on the sidewalk in front of the theater preventing protesters from going inside, including three black officers. “You are aiding and abetting in a terrorist act,” Chaverst said to the officers. He continued, saying protesters will go to schools and to police officer’s homes. “We’re going to come (to) every single place we need to until the terrorist on this police department is identified.” Protesters called on people to stop spending their money in Hoover and to instead buy holiday gifts at other shopping areas in the Birmingham area. They also called for justice for Molly, the 12-year-old girl who was shot in the back during the incident Thanksgiving night. When protesters arrived, police said the theater was not selling any more tickets for the rest of the night.",

      "full": "Elijah King was a junior at Holy Family Cristo Rey Catholic High School when freshman Emantic Bradford, Jr. walked through the doors. King didn’t originally want to attend the Ensley private school for “economically challenged families”, as it says on its website. He was a <i>public-school kid</i>, matriculating from Minor Elementary to Wenonah High, but King “did have some trouble” and the public-school system didn’t allow him to return. Holy Family was just a few blocks away from his home, though light years from his sensibility. Yet his quickly learned it was where he needed to be. “It was,” he says now, “a blessing.” He loved the small student body—about 300 students—and things that were different from public school: like everyone having lunch at the same time. Students earn $7,000 of their $9,700 annual tuition by working one day per week for local corporations. (Each student receives $2,500 scholarship and parents are responsible for the remaining portion.) Before their internships, students undergo eight weeks of training to prepare them for an environment with which they’re not likely familiar. It was during that training that King, now 24, and Bradford—the 21-year-old Hueytown native killed by Hoover police at the Riverchase Galleria mall on Thanksgiving night—became friends. “He was goofy,” King remembers. “He reminds me of Martin [Lawrence], a funny, goofy dude, full of joy, always happy. He was a character. He was my homie.” Bradford—now famously known as E.J.—will be buried Saturday at Valhalla Cemetery, following a homegoing service at the Boutwell Auditorium, where the eulogy will be given by the Rev. Jesse Jackson, Jr. He died on the floor of the mall, bleeding from at least one gunshot wound to the face, after a dispute between at least three men (including Bradford, police say) that began at the FootAction store inside the mall, escalated to gunfire and resulted in Bradford, who had a gun he was permit to carry it, being gunned down by police amid the ensuing chaos. We don’t yet know exactly what happened in the tense moments of that deadly encounter. It will almost certainly be revealed (or so every hopes) in the mall and bodycam video footage that has yet to be released by the Alabama Law Enforcement Agency (ALEA), which is overseeing the investigation into the killing. Yet, for now, we do not know. No matter what transpired, no matter what the video ultimately reveals, a young life—one filled with family and friends, challenges and obstacles and fateful choices, too—ended tragically 10 nights ago in Hoover, AL. “My son was my heart and my world,” E.J. Bradford, Sr, told me this week. “He used to sleep on my chest when he was a baby. When he got a little older, I had to run out the door to get to work while his mother held him because he didn’t want me to leave. We had that type of bond.”",

Speaking to a group of mainly freshman lawmakers on the last day of their orientation session at the Capitol auditorium, Bentley fended off at least two questions from lawmakers who grilled him over his refusal, throughout his successful 2014 re-election campaign, to consider expanding Medicaid. But then Bentley surprised many in attendance when he said he would entertain the idea of a federal block grant for Medicaid expansion. Later, he told media members at a brief conference after his speech that a block grant is on his mind, and he hasn&#x27;t ruled it out. But Bentley did not say outright that he was going to expand Medicaid. He also said his administration isn&#x27;t working on a proposal to the federal government. &quot;I wouldn&#x27;t be opposed to a block grant for the entire Medicaid system,&quot; Bentley told the media. Bentley said he would prefer a Medicaid expansion require new recipients have a job, or have a plan for work. Bentley took heat after his speech when he took questions. One person grilling him was state Rep. Mary Moore, D-Birmingham, who showed up to ask why she hasn&#x27;t heard from the governor in months. She said thousands of Alabamians don&#x27;t have access to health insurance. Bentley then admitted he wasn&#x27;t opposed to crafting an expansion of Medicaid through a block grant that Alabama could negotiate with the federal government. Bentley has been a steady holdout to expanding Medicaid, even as conservative Republican governors in Indiana and Ohio expand it, using revenue from the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare.",

(bn) When you talk about Alabama&#x27;s high infant mortality rate (the second-worst in the nation), the population most affected is the state&#x27;s low-income, at-risk mothers. Alabama has a significant Medicaid population, and its mothers and babies are no exception. More than half of all births in Alabama - 53 percent - are paid for by Medicaid. Statewide in 2012, there were 29,743 Medicaid births and 25, 072 private insurance births, according to the Alabama Department of Public Health. (Around 1,500 births were self-pay and 139 were categorized as other.) So what is Alabama - and in particular, its biggest payer of maternity costs, Medicaid - doing to improve outcomes for its poorest mothers and babies? The Alabama Medicaid Agency&#x27;s Maternity Care Program is mandatory for all pregnant women receiving Medicaid benefits, giving it the widest reach of any statewide maternal health program. What is it? The Maternity Care Program assigns each expectant mother who qualifies for Medicaid a case worker - often called a care coordinator - who provides education and assistance throughout the woman&#x27;s pregnancy and for 60 days after. The program collects data on the women it serves - from a patient&#x27;s weight to how long she breastfeeds to risk factors like smoking - and uses that to tailor broad initiatives aimed at reducing behaviors (such as smoking) and chronic conditions (such as diabetes or high blood pressure) that lead to poor health outcomes for babies and mothers. (Related: Birth in Alabama: Getting the conversation started about midwives, mortality rates and more birth options) Alabama Medicaid contracts healthcare organizations to administer its Maternity Care Program at a regional level.  The state is divided into 14 districts, with a contracted provider operating its own program within its district(s). For example, HealthGroup of Alabama - whose membership includes Huntsville Hospital and several other nonprofit hospitals in North Alabama - administers a program called Best Start in districts 1 and 2, which cover the North Alabama area. While the programs in each district have different names and are contracted by different organizations, they are set up to be more or less identical.",

A white line in the shape of that finger changes color to orange, then green. The phone chimes, and a message appears. A program developed by Hayes&#x27; company has matched more than 1,500 details from his fingerprint with the data on file, confirming his identity. &quot;What we have could easily do away with passwords and PINs,&quot; says marketing director Mac Funchess. The company will roll out the latest version of this fingerprint-recognition software, ONYX, next week. The program allows anyone with a camera in their phone to snap a photo of a fingerprint to use for identity verification. &quot;Passwords are going to go away, eventually,&quot; says co-founder and CEO Chace Hatcher. &quot;We are going to move toward biometrics and I think that fingerprint biometrics are on the top of all of those. The biggest barrier to biometrics has always been usability.&quot; Software engineers at Diamond Fortress Technologies struggled with that during the earliest stages of product development. Users must place a finger in front of the camera for authentication. In earlier versions, the program was extremely picky about how the finger was placed, and wouldn&#x27;t recognize the fingerprint unless it was in the exact same position every time. The latest version of ONYX has improved on that front, and devices can now recognize fingerprints from different angles. Biometric identification for mobile devices is not a new concept. Apple introduced TouchID in 2013, and it is available on several mobile devices. James Wayman, an expert in biometrics, writes in an e-mail that the concept of using biometrics for control dates back to the 1960s. Funchess says the ONYX system can capture more of the fingerprint, making it more secure than TouchID. It is also available to anyone with a camera on their device. So it will work just as well on a cheap knockoff phone manufactured in India as it will on a brand new Android. Funchess says the system is completely secure.",

Allouch&#x27;s death a month before expected peace talks between government and opposition representatives in Geneva is a blow to insurgents fighting to topple Assad and a boost to government forces who have been bolstered by the Russian military intervention in Syria in the past few months. It was not immediately clear who was behind his death.

It said it was not clear whether it was a Russian or Syrian airstrike. The Observatory said the warplanes struck a meeting during which Army of Islam commanders were preparing to launch an offensive against government forces and those of Lebanon&#x27;s Hezbollah near Damascus. The Local Coordination Committees earlier said that Allouch was killed along with his deputy and chief spokesman in an airstrike believed to be Russian in Otaya.

It said that the strike was carried out after a series of aerial reconnaissance operations against groupings of &quot;terrorist&quot; organizations and their headquarters in Eastern Ghouta. In addition to Allouch, it said the airstrike killed &quot;a large number of commanders of Ahrar al-Sham and Faylaq al-Rahman.&quot; It did not provide other details. It was not immediately clear how Allouch&#x27;s killing would affect his group, which is entrenched in the eastern suburbs of Damascus. Several rebel group commanders have been killed in the past -- including most of the command of the ultraconservative Ahrar al-Sham group in a mysterious bombing in northern Syria last year. For the government, it represents a further boost following recent military advances by the army, which has been on the offensive in several parts of the country since Russia began its military campaign in late September to shore up Assad&#x27;s forces. Hezbollah&#x27;s Al-Manar TV led with the news of Allouch&#x27;s killing, touting it as a victory. Syria&#x27;s state news agency SANA highlighted the news, reporting the killing of the &quot;terrorist&quot; Zahran Allouch. They did not say who was behind the airstrike that killed him. The Lebanon-based AL-Mayadeen TV said Allouch was killed during a meeting to reconcile two feuding militant factions near Damascus. The station said 13 airstrikes hit eastern Damascus on Friday. Mazen al-Shami, an opposition activist based near Damascus, said warplanes believed to be Russian fired 10 missiles at the site where Allouch and top commanders in his group were meeting in Otaya. He said several officials and commanders were killed or wounded. Another activist based near Damascus, Hadi Munajed, said four warplanes flying at high altitude attacked the meeting killing Allouch and other officials. He said he believed the warplanes were Russian because Syrian fighter jets fly at lower altitude and are not as accurate as the Russians. &quot;He was martyred this afternoon,&quot; Munajed said via Skype, referring to Allouch. Allouch, who was in his mid-40s, was widely known to be supported by Saudi Arabia and Turkey. He was one of the most powerful rebel commanders with thousands of fighters controlling large parts of the eastern Damascus suburbs known as Eastern Ghouta and Douma. In addition to fighting government forces, the Army of Islam faction fought pitched battles against its rival, the Islamic State group near Damascus. A former prisoner who was released in a general amnesty after the uprising against Assad began in March 2011, Allouch joined the armed opposition and formed the Army of Islam -- which became one of the most organized rebel factions in Syria. Critics accuse him of sectarian politics and brutal tactics similar to that of the Islamic State group. He is blamed by other opposition groups for the December 2013 kidnapping of four prominent activists including human rights activist and lawyer Razan Zaytouni. He denies holding them although they were kidnapped from an area under Army of Islam control.",

I’m reserving action to move Olmsted Falls in place of Avon until they the team plays conference leaders Berea-Midpark and Amherst. Those games should be a good a test for the Bulldogs off to a 4-2 start. Brush takes the final spot in the Top 25 under the direction of former Richmond Heights head coach Demarris Winters. With a few more bodies to pull from on his bench, Winters and the Arcs should make it a challenge for this year’s Western Reserve Conference title.

Warren is the first Gatorade Ohio Football Player of the Year to be chosen from Central Catholic High School. The award, which recognizes not only outstanding athletic excellence, but also high standards of academic achievement and exemplary character demonstrated on and off the field, distinguishes Warren as Ohio’s best high school football player. Now a finalist for the prestigious Gatorade National Football Player of the Year award to be announced in December, Collins joins an elite alumni association of state award-winners in 12 sports, including Anquan Boldin (1998-99, Pahokee HS, Fla.), Greg Olsen (2002-03, Wayne Hills HS, N.J.), Matthew Stafford (2005-06 Highland Park HS, Texas), Harrison Smith (2006-07 Knoxville Catholic High School, Tenn.), Latavius Murray (2007-08, Onondaga HS, N.Y.), Brock Osweiler (2008-09, Flathead High School, Mont.) and Leonard Fournette (2012-13, 2014-15, St. Augustine HS, La.) The 5-foot-9, 210-pound senior running back rushed for 2,740 yards and 42 touchdowns on 306 carries this past season, leading the Fighting Irish (13-1) to the Division III state semifinals. Warren also caught 11 passes for 151 yards and three scores and, as a part-time defensive back, he contributed 12 tackles and two interceptions. The Ohio Associated Press Mr. Football winner, he concluded his prep football career with 7,619 yards and 102 touchdowns rushing, both of which rank amongst the top-10 in state history. Warren has maintained a B average in the classroom and represents one of the state’s top academic candidates in meeting the Gatorade award’s broad criteria. He has volunteered locally with his school’s Student Service program and as a youth football coach. “Michael is so dangerous because he can run away and over you,” said Doug Pearson, head coach of St. John’s Jesuit High. “He’s built like a truck and has sprinter’s speed.” Warren has verbally committed to play football on scholarship at the University of Toledo in the fall of 2017. The Gatorade Player of the Year program annually recognizes one winner in the District of Columbia and each of the 50 states that sanction high school football, girls volleyball, boys and girls cross country, boys and girls basketball, boys and girls soccer, baseball, softball, and boys and girls track & field, and awards one National Player of the Year in each sport. The selection process is administered by the Gatorade Player of the Year Selection Committee, which work with top sport-specific experts and a media advisory board of accomplished, veteran prep sports journalists to determine the state winners in each sport.",

      "full": "STOW, Ohio – The Stow girls basketball team came into Saturday evening hoping to extend its early season winning streak and remain undefeated in its home opener. Suburban League National Division rivals Twinsburg (3-1, 3-0) had other ideas. The Tigers put defensive pressure on Stow early and came through in the clutch for a 41-34 win. The game got off to a slow start for both teams, as they committed to trapping their opponents and taking away the passing lanes.  The result was very few baskets for either side in the first quarter and also a handful of turnovers for both teams.  There were nine turnovers combined in the first quarter alone. “The reason it was a slow start is because this two really good defensive teams and they have two different styles of defense, but Stow always plays defensively well and their style works for them,” said Twinsburg coach Julie Solis. The offensive struggles and ball handling problems continued in the second quarter. Stow ended up committing four more turnovers in the second quarter, while the Tigers committed three.  At halftime, it was 12-9 in favor of Twinsburg. “I do think in the first half we were offensively slow,&quot; Solis said. &quot;I thought in the first half we were running through our offensive sets slow, which makes it easier to guard.  That’s something we did talk about.  We talked about penetration.  I thought we were a little passive and timid of offense.&quot; Things picked up in the second half as both teams came out and were able to execute better.  The Bulldogs found offensive life in the form of forward Theresa Parr, who scored six points in the third quarter and was able to lead Stow to its first lead of the game at the end of the third quarter, 25-22.  The Bulldogs were able to put pressure on Twinsburg and knocked away several passes, as well as stripping several Tigers players to build up some momentum offensively.  Twinsburg had seven turnovers in the third quarter. The Tigers quickly responded back thanks to the scoring of guard Jailyn Reed.  The Tigers guard poured in seven points in the fourth quarter and was able to lead Twinsburg to the impressive road victory against a conference rival. “I thought Jailyn did a great job on both ends,&quot; Solis said. &quot;She started attacking the basket in the second half and she really hasn’t been doing it that much this year.  She has the capabilities with her body control to be able to get to the basket.&quot; The Bulldogs (2-1, 2-1) were just unable to executive their offensive sets when it mattered.  They missed open jump shots, weren’t able to convert on driving lay-ups, were hounded relentlessly by Tigers’ defenders and saw a number of passes poked away by Twinsburg, resulting in points at the other end. Stow finished the game with 20 turnovers.  The Tigers were able to hold Stow to 33 percent shooting for the game.  Twinsburg was also successful at running the Bulldogs off the three-point line, as Stow attempted just seven 3-point shots the entire game and only made one.",

      "next_sentence_true": "But Lutheran East, which journeyed to a Division IV regional final last season, couldn&#x27;t quite overcome a now-experienced Vikings outfit.",
      "full": "CLEVELAND, Ohio -- Jordan Burge certainly helped narrow the gap between the No. 13 Lutheran East boys basketball team and No. 5 Villa Angela-St. Joseph, but the experienced Vikings still prevailed. Despite being without standout point guard Jerry Higgins, VASJ did just enough to eke out a road nonconference victory, 68-66, Friday night. A Shaker Heights transfer, Burge quickly showed the kind of weapon he could be for the Falcons (2-1) this season by dropping in a game-high 27 points and helping keep the hosts in it against the defending Division III runner-up. But Lutheran East, which journeyed to a Division IV regional final last season, couldn&#x27;t quite overcome a now-experienced Vikings outfit. &quot;Us this year having the experience from last year in close games, we weren&#x27;t rattled,&quot; said VASJ guard Will Butler, who sank four crucial free throws in the final minute to cement the visitors&#x27; victory. &quot;We were in this last year against Beachwood, (St. Thomas) Aquinas, (Cleveland Central Catholic); this was nothing new to us. We were ready for the moment.&quot; Burge put them to the test by consistently getting to the rim, or pulling up from behind the 3-point arc. But he missed several free throws for a Falcons team that saw a potential upset conquest evade them largely due to its work at the charity stripe. Lutheran East missed 19 free throws, with Burge failing to convert several and-1 opportunities he earned with his attacking style. Nevertheless, the junior forward had the Falcons in position to win, but Butler and the Vikings (2-1) continued to hang around. An 11-1 third-quarter run -- which included a Butler assist to Noah Newlon on a left-wing 3-pointer and accepting a fast-break pass from Danny McGarry for a fast-break layup -- turned a four-point Falcons lead into a six-point Vikings lead late in the stanza. Burge and Butler traded wing treys early in the fourth, but Lutheran East couldn&#x27;t reclaim its advantage. Butler&#x27;s fadeaway jumper with 1 minute, 15 seconds left gave the Vikings a 64-61 lead. Burge answered with two free-throw makes after a fast-break attempt, but VASJ forced Lutheran East&#x27;s top weapon into a near-NBA-range wing 3-point try on the ensuing possession, and it misfired inside of 10 seconds left. Nonetheless, the Falcons -- who made up for the transfer of Alex Heath to Cleveland Central Catholic by adding several imports of their own -- turned what was a 35-point VASJ romp in last season&#x27;s matchup into a nail-biter. &quot;Jordan Burge is one of the best scorers in the state of Ohio, bottom line,&quot; Lutheran East third-year coach Anthony Jones said. &quot;He&#x27;s strong; he&#x27;s powerful, can shoot the ball. We&#x27;re very, very happy to have him. &quot;We have to play games like this. We lost a tough one in the regional finals (to Cornerstone Christian) last year and it was in a blowout. I said, &#x27;You&#x27;ve gotta learn how to fight. You&#x27;ve gotta have more grit. You&#x27;ve gotta learn how to be tough.&#x27;&quot; Six-foot-7 sophomore Alonzo Gaffney added 17 points for VASJ, with McGarry contributing 12. VASJ seventh-year coach Babe Kwasniak has a more seasoned team than the youthful group of 2015-16 that defied skeptics all the way to the Division III title game. But the Vikings will be without Higgins for a while. The junior point guard sustained an ankle injury in Week 10 of the Falcons&#x27; football season and attempted to come back in the basketball team&#x27;s opener against Euclid, aggravating the ailment. Kwasniak said they will not rush their play-making backcourt performer back. &quot;The guy we always put the ball in his hands wasn&#x27;t there. (Jerry) does everything for us. The kids know it. They know how valuable he is and what he means to our team. For them to find a way to get this done was enormous,&quot; said Kwasniak. He described Friday as being an emotional day thanks to a confluence of factors -- one being the arrest of former VASJ blue chip talent Carlton Bragg, a current Kansas sophomore who was arrested for misdemeanor battery after an alleged fight with his girlfriend. Lutheran East junior forward Jordan Burge defends an inbound pass from Villa Angela-St. Joseph&#x27;s Danny McGarry during the fourth quarter of a nonconference matchup Friday night at Lutheran East High School. Burge scored a game-high 27 points but couldn&#x27;t lift the No. 13 Falcons to a victory over the No. 5 Vikings, who won, 68-66.       (Sam Robinson, Special to cleveland.com) VASJ will host Cleveland Central Catholic next Friday, with Lutheran East set to play host to Warrensville Heights on Tuesday.",

Duke characterized the game as a “chippy” one and said players were quickly restrained after punches flew. He added that arguments continued to escalate following the on-court incident.",

On the Bubble: Brush (3-1), Shaker Heights (2-0), Eastlake North (2-0), Nordonia (2-1), John Hay (1-1), Norton (2-1), Maple Heights (2-1), Bedford (1-2), Keystone (3-1), Windham (2-0), Shaw (1-1), Trinity (2-0), Westlake (2-1), East Tech (2-0), Holy Name (2-1), Villa Angela St. Joseph (2-2), Avon Lake (2-1). Closing thoughts: There&#x27;s a saying that the regular season is preparation for the postseason, so it&#x27;s not uncommon that readers will scratch their heads when they look at records and the names of unfamiliar opponents. Take for example Wadsworth, Twinsburg and top-ranked Solon, who all have .500 records or below. These programs have proven over the years that in order to be one of the strongest teams you have to take some blows to see your strengths and weaknesses. So as you – the reader – look over this week&#x27;s rankings, you&#x27;ll notice not too many changes have been made unless there was a head-to-head matchup like Stow and Wadsworth. In the season opener, Stow won by 18 points against the defending Suburban League National Division champions in Wadsworth. The win moved up the Bulldogs up a spot, pushing the Grizzlies down to No. 3. Gilmour was another team that moved after defeating St. Joseph Academy by 15. Hathaway Brown has not beaten Gilmour since 2013, which prompted the Blazers to remain at No. 6. In the Southwestern Conference, Amherst moves one spot below Berea-Midpark after falling by 12 to non-ranked Westlake. The Demons won the conference title in back-to-back seasons. Shaker Heights and Chardon caught my attention after wins last week against St. Vincent St. Mary and Nordonia. Chardon is the only team that moves into the Top 25 after a win against Nordonia and last year’s Akron SVSM district runner-up Canfield. Padua and Medina each climb a spot after the Chardon-Nordonia matchup. Early losses for St. Vincent St. Mary, Hoban and Bay did come as a surprise, but not enough for me to shake the rankings too much. Shaker Heights defeating STVM was nothing too bad, the Fighting Irish were a win away from reaching the regional playoffs. The same goes for Hoban falling to state semifinalist Hathaway Brown and Jackson, which is a well-respected program. However, Bay&#x27;s losses to Holy Name and Avon Lake dropped the Rockets to 21. Magnificat’s wins against Olentangy Liberty (61-36) and Olentangy (59-43) did not motivate me enough to move up the Blue Streaks after impressive weeks by Garrettsville Garfield and Lake Ridge Academy. The Olentangy teams and Magnifcat are also reloading after graduation. As the season goes along and the Blue Streaks make their case, remember their resume when they face Hathaway Brown, St. Joseph Academy and Solon. The Blue Streaks&#x27; one loss was against last year’s Walsh University District finalist North Canton Hoover, 52-42.",

      "full": "COLUMBUS, Ohio – Tim Tyrrell promised his wife no football for the next month. That might be a difficult proposition for the coach, who just oversaw Archbishop Hoban&#x27;s second straight OHSAA Division III state football championship with Saturday&#x27;s 30-0 win against Trotwood-Madison. Tyrrell sat afterward with four of his players, including two defensive stalwarts to his right, under the bleachers at Ohio Stadium. The coach didn’t hold back his belief in them. “I think we had the best defense in the state of Ohio in any division,” Tyrrell said of his 14-1 team. “No one scored on our defense the whole second half of any (playoff) game.” Such a distinction came with last year’s defense, which propelled Hoban to the school’s first state football crown. It was experienced with 10 returning starters. This one didn’t have that luxury. It might next year. Seven players who started on the defense that shut out Trotwood-Madison (12-3) on Saturday are slated to return. A few will be returning starters, including lineman Daeshon Martin and defensive back Nate Bauer. Then there&#x27;s freshman Deamonte Tayanum, who factored into last week&#x27;s second-half shutout and comeback against Columbus St. Francis DeSales. Tyrrell said the anticipation for him must wait until January. He promised his wife. “She’s home taking care of a 2-week old baby and 2-year-old and by herself,” he said. “I promised her &#x27;til at least through Christmas.” An exhausting fall peaked on the field, but included valleys with an OHSAA investigation centered around a self-reported recruiting violation with Tyrrell. The OHSAA first banned Tyrrell for the entire playoffs. A successful appeal reduced that suspension to two games, which ended with the Knights&#x27; second victory of the season against rival St. Vincent-St. Mary in the regional playoffs. Hoban buoyed two weeks without Tyrrell on the sideline by suiting up 23 seniors. Last year’s state title team had just nine. And that’s where Hoban’s challenge come January begins. Quarterback Danny Clark, who transferred to the school two years ago from Massillon, will be at the University of Kentucky. Running back Todd Sibley, who marched into the top five of Ohio’s all-time state rushing leaders, will head to Pittsburgh.",

      "full": "COLUMBUS, Ohio – The opening drive of overtime provided a glimpse to what St. Ignatius loses and has coming back. Center John Spellacy popped up after a first-down run. Hunched over, the East Carolina-bound lineman gingerly retreated to the sideline. He later returned, but St. Ignatius&#x27; 27-20 double overtime loss to Cincinnati St. Xavier for the Division I state championship ended Spellacy&#x27;s high school career. That is what St. Ignatius (13-2) loses: a leader and three-year starter who helped the Wildcats reach the ultimate stage in Ohio high school football at Ohio Stadium. When Spellacy exited for two plays, right guard John Jamieson moved into his spot. The 6-foot-2, 290-pound junior became an All-Northeast Lakes District player in his second season as a starter. Like Spellacy, he will be a rare three-year lineman for coach Chuck Kyle&#x27;s program. In all, six of 22 starters are slated to return next season from St. Ignatius’ offense and defense. That doesn’t count junior kicker Matthew Trickett, who booted two field goals, including a booming 45-yarder in the first quarter that helped the Wildcats to a 10-0 lead. The losses to graduation will be considerable. They are for most teams to reach this stage. Last year’s state champion, St. Edward, lost all but three starters from both sides of the ball. St. Xavier coach Steve Specht at least knows he can replace quarterback Sean Clifford, who will be at Penn State, with junior Chase Wolf — another QB with Division I college offers.",

He shared advice last weekend with Cuyahoga Heights’ Al Martin about what to expect in Columbus. LaVerde knew the trip well. He had been there the last five years. This was the first appearance for Martin’s school. He used a senior class in which many of its players emerged as sophomores. That year, the Redskins fell a spot short of the playoffs. They not only reached it last year but lost to Kirtland in the regional final. They entered Friday as the last undefeated team left in Ohio. “This is a really good group of seniors,” Martin said. “A lot of them have been playing since their sophomore year. It’s going to be a tall order (to replace them). We’ve got a lot of kids coming back with some talent, and we’re optimistic that we’ll have a successful season, but it remains to be seen how well we’ll do.” Marion Local (14-1) is tested from a Midwest Conference that produced three state finalists, just like it did last year. Cuyahoga Heights proved to be an equally stiff a challenge. “Their line was pretty big,” Flyers All-Ohio senior defensive end Jon Knapschaefer said. “They were getting hits on us and their fullback (Lucas D’Orazio) hit the gap real hard.” The physicality favored Marion Local in the running game. The Flyers held Cuyahoga Heights to just 47 yards rushing. But a versatile team, lead by senior quarterback Brett Lowther, found other ways. Coincidentally they fell just 47 yards short of winning the game, as Lowther’s heave on the final play hit the turf. Martin tried to console his players as they kneeled in front of him and faced Marion Local, which celebrated at midfield with the championship trophy. “It was some bad play calling by me,” Martin said. “I put them in some bad situations in the second half, when we were kind of on a roll and had them on their heels a bit.” Martin lamented using a timeout he could have saved for the final drive, which began with three consecutive passes to push the ball downfield. Senior linebacker Chad McDaniel led a second-half shutout by the defense to keep a title within reach. On what changed between halves, he thought it was simple. Simpler play calls, less blitzing and an attitude adjustment.",

Heading into Saturday’s Division III state championship game, Sibley has not reached 300 carries. “I’m a firm believer in not really beating up on tailbacks because they all have a dream to play in college,” Tyrrell said. “Most successful college tailbacks that you see nowadays for a long period of time, for over four years, really didn’t get 30 to 40 carries a game and necessarily weren’t 4,000-yard rushers in high school. They were kids that were healthy when they got to college.” RELATED: See a preview for Hoban&#x27;s state championship game. Sibley rushed 208 times for 1,412 yards and 13 touchdowns in the regular season. That means he averaged 20 carries per game in the regular season, and he also had two games of single-digit carries. But even though he has not reached 300 carries through 14 weeks, Sibley has 2,041 yards rushing and 21 TDs. “It’s definitely been a lot easier knowing I have two or three great running backs right behind me to take over the workload and if something were to happen to me or if the offensive gameplan is built around something else, that they can come in and help our offense,” Sibley said. “We’re all about who can help affect and make the team win.” Sibley had more than 58 percent of his team’s carries during the regular season. In the playoffs, that has ramped up to almost 64 percent. But against Columbus St. Francis DeSales in the Division III state semifinals on Saturday, Sibley carried the ball on 35 of the Knights’ 38 running plays for 190 yards and two touchdowns. No other Hoban running back carried the ball in its 23-14 win. “He is fresh for the playoffs,” Tyrrell said. “It’s a huge benefit to when you’re playing Week 14 and 15 and your tailback is still not over 300 carries for the season. It’s great because his shoulders are fresh, his knees are fresh. He doesn’t feel banged up and averaging 30 to 35 carries per game like some of the high school tailbacks do.” Crucial to the plan of keeping Sibley fresh was the emergence of Collier as the No. 2 back. He rushed 64 times for 466 yards and seven TD this season. Just a junior, Tyrrell said that Collier and Sibley have comparable talent. But for Collier, his goal is just to maximize the opportunities he has when he’s in the game. “I just try to do my role and, when Todd’s out, just let everyone know that when Todd’s out, there’s still somebody in there that can run the ball,” Collier said. “We just support each other, lean on each other to do good.” Collier and freshman Deamonte Trayanum, who has 25 carries in six games played for 107 yards and a touchdown, may be the combination that the Knights rely on next season when Sibley and this senior class graduates. “I’m very excited to see them in their future because they’re already great running backs and they’re learning a lot right now. I can only see bright things in their future,” Sibley said. “They’re already getting Division I looks and letters, and stuff like that.” With the help of a reduced workload, Sibley and the Knights made it through the playoffs to return to the Division III state championship on Saturday. They will face Trotwood-Madison, who is also a run-heavy football team. Led by junior RB Raveion Hargrove (162 carries, 1,562 yards, 21 TD), the Division III title could be decided by which team and win the ground game. “It definitely fires me up because we’re a physical football team. So it will be a great matchup,” Sibley said. “They’re very physical and they’re very fast. They pride themselves on defense and we do the same thing. We want to slow the game down, run the ball, and defensively, just keep getting stop after stop.” But regardless of the outcome, Saturday&#x27;s game will be the final high school game for Sibley and a senior class at Hoban that has had a massive impact. They won the school&#x27;s first state championship last year and are a win from graduating as two-time champions. “They really have completely turned the program to a level that it’s never been before, obviously, with the state championship, and getting back-to-back going to the state championship game,” Tyrrell said. “It’s an awesome thing for them to be able to come back 20 years from now at our reunion and talk about how they put Hoban’s football program on the map.”",

      "full": "COLUMBUS, Ohio — TreSean Smith and Cincinnati La Salle’s football team gave coach Jim Hilvert the perfect birthday present. The Lancers used a second-half comeback and two late takeaways to rally and defeat Massillon Perry, 14-7, for their third straight Division II state championship on Thursday at Ohio Stadium. Smith, who Hilvert moved to quarterback in the second half, rushed 17 times for 127 yards and both of his team’s touchdowns. His 12-yard touchdown run with 3:46 left gave his team the lead for good. “It just took me back to the beginning of the season,” Smith said. “I started off at quarterback, made the switch to defense. I just came out here and ran the plays that coach called.” At halftime, La Salle (13-2) had just 67 yards of total offense and starting QB Griffin Merritt completed one of eight passes for no yards and had two interceptions. “We needed to get more production,” Hilvert said. “Everything falls on me. We needed to make a change when things were not going right. We had too many turnovers and mistakes. And we needed to keep running the football. I believe when we put him at quarterback, we were going to obviously be more effective running the football. I think it showed that.” Massillon Perry (13-2) got on the board in the first quarter when Dominick Bowman stepped in front of a Merritt pass and took it 17 yards for a touchdown. Smith tied the game on La Salle’s first drive of the second half with a 3-yard touchdown. He had 64 yards rushing on that drive. “We had seen that all year. They put (Smith) there, he ran it every time,” Massillon Perry coach Keith Wakefield said. “That was their scheme. They were good up front. “We didn’t change much defensively. We just didn’t tackle very well at times.” La Salle forced two takeaways in the final three minutes when Perry tried to rally. Tyler Richardson intercepted Perry QB Max Baker with less than three minutes left.",

      "next_sentence_true": "Senior running back Jimmy Andrews still wears the brace on his left arm, extending from his wrist to elbow, as he recovers from a broken arm suffered near the end of their 31-14 win six weeks ago in Cincinnati.",
      "full": "CLEVELAND, Ohio – One play nearly derailed St. Ignatius&#x27; run to Columbus. Coach Chuck Kyle looks back on it as that one bitter anecdote on his football team&#x27;s run to play Friday night&#x27;s OHSAA Division I state championship game. It happened against St. Xavier (9-5), who the Wildcats face again at 8 p.m. at Ohio Stadium. Senior running back Jimmy Andrews still wears the brace on his left arm, extending from his wrist to elbow, as he recovers from a broken arm suffered near the end of their 31-14 win six weeks ago in Cincinnati. The three-year starter was the one skill position player Kyle didn&#x27;t have to question as the Wildcats (13-1) entered this season. “I think it somewhat spoiled the ending of that game,” Kyle said Monday. “We did some nice things and right at the last part, you lose a guy who’s been a starter since he was a sophomore. It sort of took the wind out of the sails.” Andrews split carries through the first nine games with junior Mark Bobinski. They ran behind a mammoth offensive line. Andrews provided the physicality, while Bobinski complemented him with a shifty attack. They are similar in stature; Andrews is 5-foot-11 and 195 pounds, while Bobinski is about 2 inches shorter and five pounds lighter. They didn’t know much about each other until spring workouts, when Bobinski said he began asking “a ton of questions” about playing in the backfield. “He probably got annoyed,” Bobinski added. “He’s been the leader and mentor we needed.” For the last few weeks, Bobinski can’t get enough input from his teammate and friend. Andrews stopped short of calling himself a coach, but he remained a fixture on the sideline despite the broken arm that ended his high school career. “We really needed that,” Bobinski said. “We looked to him to see how his reaction would be, and it’s been nothing but positive.” Andrews stood on the sideline Tuesday at St. Ignatius’ practice field next to the school, chatting with teammates like he has most days during this playoff run. His future is full of uncertainty. Other than a desired business major, he does not know what college to attend or if he wants to play football again. Wrestling this winter might not be a possibility. Maybe the worst part of his injury? He missed one last chance — or chances — to play rival St. Edward. Andrews lives in West Park, near a few friends from the rival Catholic school, including St. Edward quarterback Kevin Kramer. St. Ignatius senior quarterback Patrick Ryan remembers how Andrews dominated their freshman rivalry game three years ago before being elevated to varsity as a sophomore. “It’s tough to miss those games,” Andrews said. “That stung a little more than if we played another team the next week.” In both matchups, he watched friends be carted off the field. First came Colin Goodfellow&#x27;s hip injury at FirstEnergy Stadium. Then Kramer&#x27;s broken leg in the fourth quarter of the regional final rematch two weeks ago broke in similar fashion to Andrews&#x27; arm. The running back pointed to an area well above the joint of his wrist. He remembered planting his hand onto the turf in Week 9 to brace his fall. The rest happened in a flash to end his season, just like it did his friend from St. Edward. “Either the kid (a St. Xavier tackler) landed on it or I landed on myself,” Andrews said. “Not too sure.” Shock set in. Andrews said he threw up, and a trainer cut off his jersey to remove the shoulder pads. Family and friends told Andrews they were surprised how well he coped with it during the following days and weeks. “It just happened,” he said. “There’s nothing I can do about it.” Except remain a guiding presence.",

      "full": "CLEVELAND, Ohio – The buzzer sounded on Northeast Ohio basketball with a Division I regional final at Cleveland State in which neither side said it will forget. Garfield Heights emerged and advanced to Columbus thanks to Shawn Christian’s last-second shot forced overtime in the regional championship against St. Ignatius. Christian, who committed the following week to Cleveland State, is back. So is St. Ignatius. Find out how Division I shapes up in Northeast Ohio with this cleveland.com boys basketball preview. It breaks down the top 20 teams, includes a preseason all-area team and more. These 20 teams are cleveland.com’s early picks as Northeast Ohio’s best in Division I. 1. Lorain Titans Coach: John Rositano (fourth season) 2015-16 record: 22-4 (9-1 Lake Erie League), Akron/Toledo Regional semifinalist Returning starters: Jalil Little (6-0, Sr., G, 7.7 points), Naz Bohannon (6-6, Sr., F, 17.2 points, 11.0 rebounds). In the rotation: Devon Grant (6-0, So., PG), Shayne Smith (6-0, Sr., G), Daesean Brooks (6-4, Sr., G/F, 6.5 points), Octavius Wilson (6-3, Sr., F), Taevon Pierre-Louis (6-4, So., F). Outlook: At first glance, the Titans lost plenty on the perimeter – including 6-2 guard Da&#x27;viere Andrews – after a second straight district title. However, Lorain walked away from the Earl Boykins Summer League with that tournament&#x27;s crown. There are not many returning starters, but there is plenty of experience to go with Bohannon. Little, Smith and Brooks all logged critical minutes for the LEL champs. Grant also showed promise as an up-and-coming point guard. Lorain also opens its new gym — part of the school&#x27;s new building — on Dec. 6 vs. Vermilion. The Titans are bringing back Bohannon and Brooks late after their regional football run. 2. St. Edward Eagles Coach: Eric Flannery (21st season) 2015-16 record: 16-8, Strongsville District finalist Returning starters: Tommy Schmock (5-10, Sr., G, 14.8 points, 3.4 assists, 3.0 steals), Jack Sullivan (5-10, Sr., G, 10.7 points), Kelvin Calhoun (6-7, Sr., C, 5.9 points, 4.3 rebounds). In the rotation: William Henry (6-5, Jr., F), Michael Dowell (6-1, Jr., G), Devan Morrow (6-5, Sr., F), John Manno (6-0, Sr., G), Kevin Dever (6-0, Sr., G), P.J. Flannery (6-3, Jr., F), Patrick Daugherty (6-7, Jr., F), Emmett Chambers (6-8, Jr., F), Elliott Tirbaso (6-4, Jr., G), Richard White (5-9, Jr., G), Demetrius Terry (6-0, So., G), Grant Huffman (6-2, Fr., G), Devontae Blanton (6-4, Fr., F),Montorie Foster (6-0, Fr., G), . Outlook: A loss to rival St. Ignatius ended the Eagles&#x27; 2015-16 season in the district championship, concluding a philosophical change in how the Eagles play. Flannery called it an experiment to go guard-heavy, leaning on son Sean Flannery at point guard with Schmock and Sullivan. Schmock and Sullivan are back, and so is the perimeter approach. The difference is the presence of three freshmen and a sophomore, a rarity at St. Edward. &quot;This year is an exception,&quot; Eric Flannery said. &quot;We have guys who are talented enough to play.&quot; That group includes a strong shooter in Huffman to go with Blanton, whose older brother Delvon Roe starred at St. Edward and went on to Michigan State. Meanwhile, Terry can add to that nucleus of veteran guards. Flannery will lean on his seniors and moves Schmock over to the point guard spot vacated by his graduated son. 3. St. Ignatius Wildcats Coach: Brian Becker (second season, 20th overall) 2015-16 record: 20-7, Cleveland State Regional finalist Returning starters: Matt Davet (6-6, Sr., F, 12.6 points, 5.7 rebounds), Austen Yarian (6-8, Sr., F, 9.2 points, 6.0 rebounds). In the rotation: Devin Jackson (5-10, Sr., PG), Michael Spear (6-2, Sr., G), Josh O&#x27;Zanne (6-3, Jr., G), Luke Wiskes (6-4, Jr., F). Outlook: The Wildcats possess a towering luxury with Yarian, a Hillsdale College commit, and Davet. Yarian cautioned the collective size isn&#x27;t necessarily a strength. &quot;I think we had only two guys last year under 6-foot,&quot; he said. &quot;This year we have half the guys under 6-foot.&quot; The losses include versatile 6-5 standout Deven Stover and brothers Jimmy and Ryan Berger, who all graduated. Quinton Farren, a 6-4 wing, transferred to Normandy. The Wildcats open the season with back-to-back tests against Division II regional finalist Benedictine and a talented Cleveland Heights squad. Becker&#x27;s group will usher in a new starting point guard with Jackson, who spelled Kyle Kalish last season. A last-second 3-pointer by Garfield Heights&#x27; Shawn Christian in regulation was all that kept the Wildcats from Columbus. That ending will fuel this group. &quot;Our team motto this year is make one more play,&quot; Davet said. &quot;One more play wins us that ballgame.&quot; 4. Garfield Heights Bulldogs Coach: Sonny Johnson (13th season) 2015-16 record: 24-4, state semifinalist Returning starters: Marreon Jackson (6-0, Sr., PG, 13.0 points, 7.0 rebounds), Shawn Christian (6-0, Sr., G, 14.0 points, 3.0 rebounds). In the rotation: Leonard Cottrell (6-5, Sr., F), Brison Waller (6-8, So., F), Jermaine Johnson (6-7, Sr., C), Julian Whiteside (5-11, Jr., G), McRay White (6-6, Sr., F), Jessie Laster (6-2, Fr., F), Donovan Forte (6-7, Jr., C). Outlook: Jackson and Christian give the Bulldogs one of the state&#x27;s premier backcourts. Both are headed to Division I colleges; Jackson committed in February to Toledo, while Christian made a pact with Cleveland State just days after his last-second 3-pointer forced overtime on the Wolstein Center floor. It ultimately lifted Garfield Heights past St. Ignatius and to the state&#x27;s final four. Three newcomers transferred in: Cottrell from John Hay, Waller from Rhodes and Forte. They expect to sit out the first 11 games, per OHSAA transfer rules. 5. Mentor Cardinals Coach: Bob Krizancic (24th season) 2015-16 record: 15-11 (6-8 Greater Cleveland Conference), Euclid District finalist. Returning starters: Jack Korsok (6-2, Sr., G, 12.4 points), Caden Kryz (6-3, Jr., G, 9.7 points), Allen Sims (6-3, Sr., F, 7.2 points), Tadas Tatarunas (6-5, Jr., F). In the rotation: Manning Trubisky (6-2, Sr., G, 8.2 points), Xavier Cheek (6-9, Sr., F), Matt Koski (6-5, Jr., F), Shane Zalba (5-9, Jr., G), Chad Blessing (6-3, Jr., G), Ben Gingrich (5-9, Jr., G), Luke Floriea (5-9, Fr., PG). Outlook: A last-second loss to Solon for the district champion ended a season in which Mentor battled injuries. Point guard Andrew Valeri missed time, and it kept the Cardinals off balanced. A contender to take the point guard spot this season is Floriea, a backup quarterback on the football team. The rest of the squad has gained experience with leading scorer Korsok and an emerging standout in Kryz, who enters Year 3 on varsity. The core group played well at the Earl Boykins Summer League and has a mix of shooting with athleticism. Expect them to run and press, as usual. 6. Cleveland Heights Tigers Coach: Jeremy Holmes (second season) 2015-16 record: 9-16 (5-5 Lake Erie League), Euclid District semifinalist Returning starters: Yahel Hill (6-0, Jr., G, 15.8 points, 4.6 assists, 3.5 rebounds), Jaylen Harris (6-5, Sr., F, 16.2 points, 9.8 rebounds). In the rotation: Tyreke Smith (6-4, Jr., F), Grayson Green (6-2, Jr., G), Javon Roberts (6-1, Jr., G), Cory Hicks (6-3, Sr., F). Outlook: Heights&#x27; backcourt took a hit with junior guard Chaz Hardin moving out of state, but expect Roberts to step in with Hill — who holds college offers from Toledo, Akron, Ohio, Kent State and Stoneybrook. The Tigers played one of the area&#x27;s toughest schedules last season, which took them to a district semifinal against Solon. They also will continue to play away from home as the high school is rebuilt. Last season, the Tigers played a handful of &quot;home games&quot; at Lutheran East. They switched this season to Warrensville Heights. Cleveland Heights also organized a season-opening showcase, the Great Lakes Classic. It will be held at Maple Heights on Saturday and Sunday. The Tigers will be tested by matchups with St. Ignatius and Cornerstone Christian. Other participants include East Tech, Glenville, Lutheran East, Maple Heights, MLK, New Day, Orange, Rhodes and Richmond Heights. 7. Brecksville Bees Coach: Steve Mehalik (10th season)",

      "full": "CLEVELAND, Ohio – The buzzer sounded on Northeast Ohio basketball with a Division I regional final at Cleveland State in which neither side said it will forget. Garfield Heights emerged and advanced to Columbus thanks to Shawn Christian’s last-second shot forced overtime in the regional championship against St. Ignatius. Christian, who committed the following week to Cleveland State, is back. So is St. Ignatius. Find out how Division I shapes up in Northeast Ohio with this cleveland.com boys basketball preview. It breaks down the top 20 teams, includes a preseason all-area team and more. These 20 teams are cleveland.com’s early picks as Northeast Ohio’s best in Division I. 1. Lorain Titans Coach: John Rositano (fourth season) 2015-16 record: 22-4 (9-1 Lake Erie League), Akron/Toledo Regional semifinalist Returning starters: Jalil Little (6-0, Sr., G, 7.7 points), Naz Bohannon (6-6, Sr., F, 17.2 points, 11.0 rebounds). In the rotation: Devon Grant (6-0, So., PG), Shayne Smith (6-0, Sr., G), Daesean Brooks (6-4, Sr., G/F, 6.5 points), Octavius Wilson (6-3, Sr., F), Taevon Pierre-Louis (6-4, So., F). Outlook: At first glance, the Titans lost plenty on the perimeter – including 6-2 guard Da&#x27;viere Andrews – after a second straight district title. However, Lorain walked away from the Earl Boykins Summer League with that tournament&#x27;s crown. There are not many returning starters, but there is plenty of experience to go with Bohannon. Little, Smith and Brooks all logged critical minutes for the LEL champs. Grant also showed promise as an up-and-coming point guard. Lorain also opens its new gym — part of the school&#x27;s new building — on Dec. 6 vs. Vermilion. The Titans are bringing back Bohannon and Brooks late after their regional football run. 2. St. Edward Eagles Coach: Eric Flannery (21st season) 2015-16 record: 16-8, Strongsville District finalist Returning starters: Tommy Schmock (5-10, Sr., G, 14.8 points, 3.4 assists, 3.0 steals), Jack Sullivan (5-10, Sr., G, 10.7 points), Kelvin Calhoun (6-7, Sr., C, 5.9 points, 4.3 rebounds). In the rotation: William Henry (6-5, Jr., F), Michael Dowell (6-1, Jr., G), Devan Morrow (6-5, Sr., F), John Manno (6-0, Sr., G), Kevin Dever (6-0, Sr., G), P.J. Flannery (6-3, Jr., F), Patrick Daugherty (6-7, Jr., F), Emmett Chambers (6-8, Jr., F), Elliott Tirbaso (6-4, Jr., G), Richard White (5-9, Jr., G), Demetrius Terry (6-0, So., G), Grant Huffman (6-2, Fr., G), Devontae Blanton (6-4, Fr., F),Montorie Foster (6-0, Fr., G), . Outlook: A loss to rival St. Ignatius ended the Eagles&#x27; 2015-16 season in the district championship, concluding a philosophical change in how the Eagles play. Flannery called it an experiment to go guard-heavy, leaning on son Sean Flannery at point guard with Schmock and Sullivan. Schmock and Sullivan are back, and so is the perimeter approach. The difference is the presence of three freshmen and a sophomore, a rarity at St. Edward. &quot;This year is an exception,&quot; Eric Flannery said. &quot;We have guys who are talented enough to play.&quot; That group includes a strong shooter in Huffman to go with Blanton, whose older brother Delvon Roe starred at St. Edward and went on to Michigan State. Meanwhile, Terry can add to that nucleus of veteran guards. Flannery will lean on his seniors and moves Schmock over to the point guard spot vacated by his graduated son. 3. St. Ignatius Wildcats Coach: Brian Becker (second season, 20th overall) 2015-16 record: 20-7, Cleveland State Regional finalist Returning starters: Matt Davet (6-6, Sr., F, 12.6 points, 5.7 rebounds), Austen Yarian (6-8, Sr., F, 9.2 points, 6.0 rebounds). In the rotation: Devin Jackson (5-10, Sr., PG), Michael Spear (6-2, Sr., G), Josh O&#x27;Zanne (6-3, Jr., G), Luke Wiskes (6-4, Jr., F). Outlook: The Wildcats possess a towering luxury with Yarian, a Hillsdale College commit, and Davet. Yarian cautioned the collective size isn&#x27;t necessarily a strength. &quot;I think we had only two guys last year under 6-foot,&quot; he said. &quot;This year we have half the guys under 6-foot.&quot; The losses include versatile 6-5 standout Deven Stover and brothers Jimmy and Ryan Berger, who all graduated. Quinton Farren, a 6-4 wing, transferred to Normandy. The Wildcats open the season with back-to-back tests against Division II regional finalist Benedictine and a talented Cleveland Heights squad. Becker&#x27;s group will usher in a new starting point guard with Jackson, who spelled Kyle Kalish last season. A last-second 3-pointer by Garfield Heights&#x27; Shawn Christian in regulation was all that kept the Wildcats from Columbus. That ending will fuel this group. &quot;Our team motto this year is make one more play,&quot; Davet said. &quot;One more play wins us that ballgame.&quot; 4. Garfield Heights Bulldogs Coach: Sonny Johnson (13th season) 2015-16 record: 24-4, state semifinalist Returning starters: Marreon Jackson (6-0, Sr., PG, 13.0 points, 7.0 rebounds), Shawn Christian (6-0, Sr., G, 14.0 points, 3.0 rebounds). In the rotation: Leonard Cottrell (6-5, Sr., F), Brison Waller (6-8, So., F), Jermaine Johnson (6-7, Sr., C), Julian Whiteside (5-11, Jr., G), McRay White (6-6, Sr., F), Jessie Laster (6-2, Fr., F), Donovan Forte (6-7, Jr., C). Outlook: Jackson and Christian give the Bulldogs one of the state&#x27;s premier backcourts. Both are headed to Division I colleges; Jackson committed in February to Toledo, while Christian made a pact with Cleveland State just days after his last-second 3-pointer forced overtime on the Wolstein Center floor. It ultimately lifted Garfield Heights past St. Ignatius and to the state&#x27;s final four. Three newcomers transferred in: Cottrell from John Hay, Waller from Rhodes and Forte. They expect to sit out the first 11 games, per OHSAA transfer rules. 5. Mentor Cardinals Coach: Bob Krizancic (24th season) 2015-16 record: 15-11 (6-8 Greater Cleveland Conference), Euclid District finalist. Returning starters: Jack Korsok (6-2, Sr., G, 12.4 points), Caden Kryz (6-3, Jr., G, 9.7 points), Allen Sims (6-3, Sr., F, 7.2 points), Tadas Tatarunas (6-5, Jr., F). In the rotation: Manning Trubisky (6-2, Sr., G, 8.2 points), Xavier Cheek (6-9, Sr., F), Matt Koski (6-5, Jr., F), Shane Zalba (5-9, Jr., G), Chad Blessing (6-3, Jr., G), Ben Gingrich (5-9, Jr., G), Luke Floriea (5-9, Fr., PG). Outlook: A last-second loss to Solon for the district champion ended a season in which Mentor battled injuries. Point guard Andrew Valeri missed time, and it kept the Cardinals off balanced. A contender to take the point guard spot this season is Floriea, a backup quarterback on the football team. The rest of the squad has gained experience with leading scorer Korsok and an emerging standout in Kryz, who enters Year 3 on varsity. The core group played well at the Earl Boykins Summer League and has a mix of shooting with athleticism. Expect them to run and press, as usual. 6. Cleveland Heights Tigers Coach: Jeremy Holmes (second season) 2015-16 record: 9-16 (5-5 Lake Erie League), Euclid District semifinalist Returning starters: Yahel Hill (6-0, Jr., G, 15.8 points, 4.6 assists, 3.5 rebounds), Jaylen Harris (6-5, Sr., F, 16.2 points, 9.8 rebounds). In the rotation: Tyreke Smith (6-4, Jr., F), Grayson Green (6-2, Jr., G), Javon Roberts (6-1, Jr., G), Cory Hicks (6-3, Sr., F). Outlook: Heights&#x27; backcourt took a hit with junior guard Chaz Hardin moving out of state, but expect Roberts to step in with Hill — who holds college offers from Toledo, Akron, Ohio, Kent State and Stoneybrook. The Tigers played one of the area&#x27;s toughest schedules last season, which took them to a district semifinal against Solon. They also will continue to play away from home as the high school is rebuilt. Last season, the Tigers played a handful of &quot;home games&quot; at Lutheran East. They switched this season to Warrensville Heights. Cleveland Heights also organized a season-opening showcase, the Great Lakes Classic. It will be held at Maple Heights on Saturday and Sunday. The Tigers will be tested by matchups with St. Ignatius and Cornerstone Christian. Other participants include East Tech, Glenville, Lutheran East, Maple Heights, MLK, New Day, Orange, Rhodes and Richmond Heights. 7. Brecksville Bees Coach: Steve Mehalik (10th season) 2015-16 record: 20-4 (13-1 Suburban League National Division), Strongsville District semifinalist Returning starters: Matt Dimitrijevs (6-1, Sr., G), Jared Bazil (6-7, Sr., C). In the rotation: Kenny Ganley (6-4, So., PG), Michael Rose (6-4, Jr., F), Sam Wiglusz (6-0, Jr., G), Griffin Stevens (6-0, Sr., G), Cam Seibert (6-1, Jr., G), Marko Jakovljevic (6-8, Sr., C), Jimmy Tyler (6-1, Jr., G), Matt Harwood (6-0, Sr., G), Tyler Kasmarcak (5-10, Jr., G). Outlook: The Bees&#x27; top priority is addressing the point guard spot, vacated by Suburban League MVP Dan Auble. Mehalik will turn to Ganley, a sophomore who last season played between varsity and JV and saw time as a forward. &quot;You can&#x27;t replace a Danny Auble,&quot; Mehalik said, &quot;but Kenny is versatile. You can post him up, have him come off ball screens and set ball screens. When you have a shooter like Matt (Dimitrijevs) on the floor, it opens up things a bit.&quot; Bazil is back as a third-year starter and could have company in the post with an emerging senior in Jakovljevic. Rose and Wiglusz come over from successful football seasons. Stevens and Seibert round out the rest of Brecksville&#x27;s main rotation entering the season. 8. Shaker Heights Raiders Coach: Danny Young (ninth season) 2015-16 record: 9-15 (5-7 Greater Cleveland Conference), Solon District quarterfinalist Returning starters: Dale Bonner (6-3, Jr., PG, 8.9 points), J&#x27;Van Beasley (6-2, Sr., G, 10.9 points), Amani Redus (6-2, Sr., G, 15.4 points), George Evans (6-4, Sr., C, 9.8 points). In the rotation: Christian Guess (6-6, Jr., G), Kevin Bishop (6-4, So., F, 8.4 points), James Williams (6-2, Sr., G, 8.6 points), Nick Ferguson (6-5, Fr., F), Naj Hardaway (6-2, Jr., G), Isiah Wright (6-2, Sr., G, 6.3 points), B.J. Carter (6-2, So., G). Outlook: There&#x27;s a little of the same and a little new for the Raiders. Junior guard Jordan Burge transferred to Lutheran East this summer. So did point guard Maurico Tate, who transferred from Westlake and played on Shaker Heights&#x27; summer league team. Yet Shaker Heights is still loaded with guards. Start with Bonner, who emerged as a sophomore and now could be one of the area&#x27;s best. Young&#x27;s squad added an athletic standout who plays above the rim in Guess, a Glenville transfer. Redus and Beasley were steady on the perimeter, so the question mark remains inside. The Raiders have struggled to rebound since Esa Ahmad&#x27;s graduation in 2015. Evans has shouldered the burden, while Bishop flashes potential. 9. Medina Bees Coach: Chris Hassinger (third season) 2015-16 record: 19-7 (11-3 Greater Cleveland Conference), Copley District finalist. Returning starters: Jackson Sartain (6-1, Sr., G), Ben Geschke (6-1, Sr., G), Luke Schaefer (6-4, Sr., F). In the rotation: Jimmy Daw (6-4, Sr., F/C), Tyler Kaminski (6-7, Jr., C), Colin Szumski (5-11, Jr., G), Sam McKee (6-6, Sr., F), Dylan Fultz (5-10, Jr., G), Shane Cullen (6-5, Sr., F). Outlook: Sure, Medina graduated 7-foot-1 Jon Teske. He is now at Michigan. But there&#x27;s still plenty back for the Bees, who still have some height to complement an athletic bunch. Start with Schaefer and Geschke, entering their third year as starters. Then add in some hard-nosed players, such as Daw — a touchdown machine at running back for the football team — and Medina has the pieces for another GCC and postseason contender. 10. Archbishop Hoban Knights Coach: T.K. Griffith (24th season) 2015-16 record: 18-6 (8-2 in North Coast League), Copley District semifinalist. Returning starters: Collen Gurley (6-1, Jr., G, 13.0 points), Garret Houser (6-0, Jr., G, 9.0 points), Cartier Bickley (6-1, Sr., F, 10.0 points), Brian Cuppett (6-3, Sr., F, 10.3 points). In the rotation: Matt Salopek (6-2, So, F), Jabari Taylor (6-3, Sr., F). Outlook: The Knights are quick and guard oriented. They graduated standout Anthony Christian, and again will have the same challenge as last year — transitioning a bevy of football players from that team&#x27;s postseason run. 11. Stow Bulldogs Coach: David Close (29th season) 2015-16 record: 19-6 (10-4 Suburban League National Division), Copley District semifinalist Returning starters: Coryon Rice (6-0, Jr., G, 10.2 points, 3.0 rebounds, 2.0 assists), Logan Lindsay (6-2, Sr., G, 7.0 points, 3.0 rebounds, 2.0 assists), Nick Kollar (6-2, Sr., G, 3.0 points, 3.0 rebounds, 2.0 assists). In the rotation: Justin Harvey (6-5, Sr., F, 2.5 points, 2.0 rebounds), Jordan Jolly (6-2, Sr., G, 2.0 points), Mason McMurray (6-7, Jr., F), Evan Bainbridge (6-7, So., F). Outlook: The Bulldogs again should be one of Brecksville&#x27;s top challengers in the Suburban League. Close, who already has 530 wins, is just 18 victories shy of 500 at Stow. The backcourt is established with Rice, a talented junior, and Lindsay fresh off his run with the football team. McMurray and Bainbridge enjoyed productive offseason and should be a welcomed presence with their height. 12. Maple Heights Mustangs Coach: Eric Schmidt (second season) 2015-16 record: 15-9 (5-5 Lake Erie League), Solon District semifinalist Returning starters: Alfonse Hale (6-0, Jr., PG, 19.0 points, 4.0 assists), Marcus Kimmie (5-9, Jr., G, 8.0 points, 3.0 assists), Tyree Harris (6-2, Sr., F, 12.0 points, 6.0 rebounds), Deshawn Garner (6-3, Jr., F, 10.0 points, 10.0 rebounds). In the rotation: Ja&#x27;Vonte Richardson (6-4, Sr., F, 8.0 points, 8.0 rebounds), Dashon Palmer (5-8, Jr., G, 3.0 steals), Keyshawn Ford (6-2, Jr., F). Outlook: Maple Heights is in position to become the LEL&#x27;s most improved team, which makes the Mustangs a candidate to achieve that distinction for the area. Hale leads the way, and being among four returning starters bodes well for Schmidt entering his second season as coach. The schedule increases with difficulty, and the non-league portion includes Hudson, Orange, Medina, Brecksville, Lutheran East and Warren Harding. 13. Ellet Orangemen Coach: Mark Fisher (sixth season) 2015-16 record: 13-9 (8-4 Akron City Series), Alliance District quarterfinalist Returning starters: A.J. Gareri (6-9, Sr., F, 22.6 points, 10.5 rebounds), Marquise Bridges (5-10, Sr., G), Jarrett Jones (6-0, Sr., G), Joe Williams (6-2, Sr., G/F), Marquis Smith (6-2, Sr., F), Alfred Johnson (6-7, Jr., C). In the rotation: Jesse Nance (5-10, So., G), Jacob Kline (6-1, Sr., G), Stephen Zampelli (5-8, Jr., G). Outlook: Start with Gareri, the versatile longtime starter who is headed to Ohio University next year. Ellet took a step back last season with an inexperienced team around him, but that&#x27;s not the case anymore. This is a senior-laden group and includes scoring threats with Bridges and Jones. Johnson provides shot blocking with a 7-2 wing span, while Kline and Zampelli are long-distance shooting threats. Williams is cleared to play basketball, Fisher said, after missing the football season for medical reasons. A strong defenders and leaper, he played outside linebacker and tight end on the gridiron. On the schedule front, Ellet picked up the Alliance Christmas Classic on Dec. 27 at Mount Union in place of the defunct Dunk 4 Diabetes at Walsh University. 14. Elyria Pioneers Coach: Brett Larrick (ninth season) 2015-16 record: 15-7 (10-4 Greater Cleveland Conference), Elyria Catholic District participant Returning starters: Dez Brown (5-10, Sr., PG), Antonio Blanton (6-0, Sr., G, 16.0 points), Josh Lotko (6-5, Sr., F, 6.0 points), Justin Koepp (6-7, Jr., C). In the rotation: Darquan Woods (6-6, Sr., C), Mike Oliver (6-1, Sr., G), Tone Brown (6-1, Sr., G), Deviian Williams (6-2, Jr., G/F). Outlook: Lorain County Mr. Basketball winner Blake Furcron is graduated, but Elyria brings back its four other starters. Blanton is one of the area&#x27;s most accurate outside shooters, and should continue to find open looks with two sizeable teammates in Lotko and Koepp in front of him. 15. Brunswick Blue Devils",

Playoff history: St. Ignatius has 11 state championships, the most in OHSAA history. Maria Stein Local and Newark Catholic are the closest with eight each. The Wildcats own a 70-15 all-time playoff record and aim to win the title after failing to reach the 2015 playoffs. They missed the playoffs only twice since 1988. The other time, in 2010, they came back to win it all. St. Ignatius is 11-1 in state championship games. About St. Ignatius: The Wildcats rode a stellar defense to four regular-season shutouts on its way back to the playoffs. They have five total shutouts and kept opponents to single digits in eight games. A trio of senior linebackers — Adam Shibley, James Leyden and John Velotta — led the way. Offensively, the Wildcats overcame a broken arm to senior running back and three-year starter Jimmy Andrews during the Wildcats&#x27; 31-14 Week 9 win at St. Xavier. A seasoned offensive line, led by East Carolina-bound John Spellacy at center, helped the Wildcats overcome that injury. ST.

Playoff history: At 40-20 in the playoffs, the Bombers own two state titles. Their last crown came in 2007, and they faced the Wildcats in the 2011 title game. The Wildcats won that game, plus the 1992 final. About St. Xavier: Penn State-bound senior quarterback Sean Clifford did not play the Week 9 game between these teams in Cincinnati. Instead, junior Chase Wolfe took the snaps. He holds a college offer from Wisconsin, and Bombers coach Steve Specht isn&#x27;t shy about playing both at the same time. They also made the playoffs with just a 5-5 record, and still earned the fifth seed. &quot;If you look at our schedule this year, it was arguably the toughest schedule in the country,&quot; Specht said this week. In Week 1, the Bombers lost to St. John Bosco, a California state title contender. They even faced Colerain, the No. 1 team in cleveland.com&#x27;s Ohio Super 25, losing in overtime during Week 2. St. Xavier came back to win their rematch in the playoffs, also an overtime game. If St. Xavier wins Friday, it will be the first 5-5 team to win a state championship.

In fact, Cuyahoga Heights shut them out twice with a 21-0 road win in Week 9. Both wins were vital, as Kirtland beat the Redskins at both stages of last season.

Or later that summer at Glenville, before his sophomore year, when Guess said a man with a gun approached him. “After a while, I realized I can’t be around here,” he said. “Most of the people love me, but it’s still others that have nonsense going on.” Guess&#x27; up-and-down basketball career pales in comparison to his life experiences, which took him from house to house with his family, then to Glenville for his first two years of high school. He is now Shaker Heights, which he called a &quot;culture shock&quot; more than a year ago. That is not because he is 6-foot-6 and stands out in a hallway or basketball court. He met few people he thought understood him. His mood swings. His outspoken demeanor. His smile, his frustration: it all came with him to Shaker Heights. Danny Young, aware of it from Guess’ two years at Glenville, made Guess a personal a project. For much of Guess’ first school year in Shaker Heights, they routinely “bumped heads,” Young said. They exchanged text messages, sometimes past midnight when something bothered Guess and both had to be at school in the morning. Young is a principal at Woodbury Elementary School. Guess attends Shaker Heights’ Innovative Center for “at-risk” high school students. Young said Guess takes NCAA-certified courses, the same program that helped Esa Ahmad earn a scholarship two years ago to West Virginia University. Coincidentally, West Virginia coach Bob Huggins visited Shaker Heights earlier this week to further investigate Guess. The Mountaineers have not formally offered a scholarship, but Young said Guess&#x27; grades are now at the point that schools can take him. That was not the case a year ago, when he missed the first half of the season because of academic eligibility. Now, following a 57-point outburst Friday at Mentor that gave him Shaker Heights&#x27; single-game scoring record, more colleges are beginning to inquire. Guess already has offers from DePaul, Kent State, Toledo, Ohio, Indiana State and James Madison. “I’m so proud of him,” Young said Wednesday. “Last year I wouldn’t have said that. “I’ve seen a total transformation, and that was obvious when West Virginia was in town and we analyzed his grades. His grades were a lot higher with his core GPA than I realized.” Guess credits the push from his mother, Tracy Clark, who moved him from home to home and ultimately found a way to Shaker Heights, away from the dangers he previously faced. This summer, his father, Clark Guess, called old friend Malcolm Sims — Shaker’s all-time scoring leader — and asked if he would host Christian for a few weeks in Atlanta. Sims agreed. Coincidentally, Guess broke his single-game record of 55 points set in 1992. RELATED: See Northeast Ohio&#x27;s 50-point club. “When he got back, I was able to coach him a little bit harder,” Young said. “I was able to get into him and it not turn into an argument.” Guess also benefited from workouts with former Ohio State football lineman and Shaker Heights graduate Adrien Clarke, who trains with most of Young’s players. Guess said his mother drives him. When his mood swings now, he thinks of her. How it could affect his standing with a potential scholarship? Sometimes he still nearly forgets during the moment of game, such as Wednesday&#x27;s rivalry matchup at Garfield Heights, by pointing to rapper Machine Gun Kelly after one basket and looking to the crowd at nearly every opportunity. Each time, Guess’ teammates came to him, sometimes cutting his interaction short. They have become his backbone, too. “I think it’s really helped bolstered his attitude,” Young said. Guess is in a better place. The memories of two years ago at Glenville’s rec center remind him of that. “We’re looking around and it’s in the middle of the day,” he said. “And you could just hear them (the bullets) flying past my head and smacking the playground next to me. It was a very scary moment.” That is why Guess is thankful — and surprised — to be here. “I didn’t think I was going to see it past that day,” he said.

Daeshon Martin, Archbishop Hoban Martin       (Archbishop Hoban) Height: 6-foot-3 Weight: 250 pounds Year: Senior About Martin: Hoban had one of the top run defenses in the area, if not the state, and Martin contributed to it by playing end and tackle on the Knights&#x27; defensive front. The evolution of this position, which reflects in Martin, is why the line on this side of the ball is not separated by ends and tackles. Martin is headed to the University of Cincinnati on a football scholarship after leading Hoban to its third straight state championship. Tyreke Smith, Cleveland Heights Smith       (Cleveland Heights) Height: 6-4 Weight: 260 Year: Senior About Smith: After just two years of high school football, Smith will head to one of the country&#x27;s top college programs next year. He will announce that decision — down to Ohio State, Penn State, Alabama, USC and Oregon — on Jan. 4. Until then, add cleveland.com and All-Ohio Defensive Player of the Year awards to his awards after a stat-stuffing season at defensive end.

Noah Potter, Mentor Potter       (Mentor) Height: 6-6 Weight: 250 Year: Junior About Potter: Like Smith, Potter could be headed to a Power Five conference school next year. Ohio State and Penn State have offered him, and that was before his play helped Mentor reach the Division I state championship game. Before that? Potter had eight sacks in the regular season.

Standing 6-foot-4 and weighing 260 points, Smith took down opposing quarterbacks for 11 sacks. He had 23 tackles for loss, 22 QB pressures, six passes batted down and 52 solo tackles. Cleveland Heights finished 4-6, but closed with consecutive shutouts and a 2-0 victory in the season finale with a safety courtesy of — who else, but — Smith. He doubled as a tight end and caught four touchdown passes with an 89 percent blocking efficiency. &quot;Just starting out to play football and coming out and getting all these offers and players of the year, it&#x27;s crazy,&quot; said Smith, who also shared All-Ohio Defensive Player of the Year in Division I with Xavier Henderson of state champion Pickerington Central. &quot;But I worked hard. Put in a lot of hours with Coach Mac (Stephens) and at camps. My mom and dad (Michelle and Randy Smith), my parents put a lot of effort into it.&quot; That effort will soon pay in the form of a free college education.

The Blue Devils knocked down 13 shots from behind the 3-point arc, including a buzzer-beating shot from 6-foot-6 Zak Zografos to end the first quarter. It send the Blue Devils, No. 18 in this week&#x27;s cleveland.com boys basketball rankings, to a 79-53 Greater Cleveland Conference runaway win vs. rival Strongsville. “The last couple of years we’ve been able to shoot the ball from the outside,” Zografos said. “This year it’s more run and gun, and we still have guys that can knock down shots. Everyone’s getting to the rim. Everyone’s finishing.” Zografos scored a game-high 20 points and senior forward Danny Dakdouk added 16 off the bench, sending the Blue Devils (3-1, 2-0) to a double-digit lead within the first eight minutes. Considering the long-distance shooting, the end result of a trapping defense that initiated Brunswick’s attack. Coach Joe Mackey called for it repeatedly following baskets, and Strongsville (0-4, 0-1) struggled to advance within a fourth of the court’s length at times. The Mustangs committed five turnovers in that first-quarter stretch. Brunswick’s lead quickly hit 23-11 and ballooned to 32-16 early in the second quarter, thanks to Dakdouk’s finishes in transition around the basket. “He’s Vinnie Johnson. He’s the microwave. That’s what we call him,” Mackey said, referring to the Detroit Pistons&#x27; acclaimed instant offense guard. “He’s got to keep getting better defensively, like a lot of our guys do.

This builds my confidence up a lot. I took third here last year with all my friends and family around, and they really helped. This year, the people around me who supported me were all here and I was able to finish one match better. It feels so great. “This win wouldn’t be possible if not for the power of God.

It is the effect of a mentality Brand set forth entering this season. “You guys are going to play my defense,” Brand said he told them, “and you guys can play your offense. So now they feel like they have ownership, and they do.” VASJ (1-1) hung around until midway through the fourth quarter. Cleveland Heights began an eight-point spurt, as Smith forced turnovers and put back his misses. The 6-foot-5 forward, who is among the most coveted football players in the nation, looked more the part of a basketball player as he weaved past defenders and dominated the baseline.",

      "full": "CANTON, Ohio — John Dirksen hulked over the line of scrimmage awaiting the snap of the football. As Marion Local&#x27;s lead grew, eventually leading to a 34-11 win Saturday in the OHSAA Division VI state championship vs. Kirtland, the 6-foot-5 Notre Dame recruit grew jovial. Dirksen’s 290-pound frame hopped up and down in celebration. He missed this game a year ago because of a broken leg. The two-way tackle said Marion Local’s loss two years ago had more to do with it. “Playing against a team that beat you and kind of embarrassed your program, it’s a great motivator,” Dirksen said. “When you’ve got the lead, you just got to keep building it and have fun with your teammates.” Two years ago, Kirtland rallied from a 13-point deficit and beat Dirksen&#x27;s Flyers with a 22-20 comeback in Columbus. Playing this time in Canton&#x27;s Tom Benson Hall of Fame Stadium, Marion Local (15-0) took a 20-3 lead into halftime discontent with that effort. “John pumped them up at halftime,” Marion Local coach Tim Goodwin said. “I can’t tell you what he said, but I’ll just tell you he pumped them up.” Marion Local moved into second place on the OHSAA’s all-time state football championships list with a 10th title, trailing just St. Ignatius. Trying to equal the Division I Wildcats&#x27; 11 trophies might be just as difficult for Marion Local as it has been the last few years for Division VI teams to take down the Flyers. Marion Local will no longer have Dirksen and two other linemen on that massive front, but it should have quarterback Nathan Bruns and top receiver Nick Tangeman. The juniors connected six times Saturday for 120 yards and two touchdowns, giving a glimpse into the Flyers&#x27; potential direction. And Kirtland could be better. The Hornets back two 1,000-yard rushers in Joey Torok and Jake Neibecker. Coach Tiger LaVerde’s Hornets also will have three linemen, including center Austin Fulco — who snapped for the last time to older brother Dylan Fulco at quarterback. LaVerde hinted that he likes their chances next year, but would not get too far ahead of himself. “They’re very, very motivated young men. They’ve learned from these kids,” said LaVerde, looking to his seniors after leaving the field. “The junior class is a special group, and that’s our goal is to obviously win Week 1 next year.” Just Week 1.

The Flyers built a 20-3 lead at halftime on a 10-yard touchdown pass from junior quarterback Nathan Bruns to junior Nick Tangeman, and a three-yard run by senior fullback Jack Buening. That score was set up after a Bruns’ 31-yard pass to Tangeman. The Flyers outgained Kirtland on offense 187-97 in the first half and piled on the points in the final two quarters. “We had a goal basically all week that we wanted to come over here and play our best game of the season,” Marion Local coach Tim Goodwin said.

The teams led by Lucas D&#x27;Orazio&#x27;s older brothers, Zach and Jordan, did not get here. Dylan Drummond doubted many believed they could, either. “A lot of people didn’t think we’d make it back,” Drummond said. “A lot of people didn’t think we’d make it last year in the first place.” Division VI powerhouse Marion Local stood in Cuyahoga Heights’ way last year. This year in the D-VII title game, it was Minster. The Wildcats, like Marion Local, came out of the small-school juggernaut league, the Midwest Athletic Conference. They lost in last year’s D-VII title game and sought their second championship in four years. Drummond, an Eastern Michigan commit at wide receiver, pulled Cuyahoga Heights even with them on the scoreboard on a 28-yard touchdown pass in the first quarter. The Redskins (12-2) lost control as Minster (11-4) scored on its final two possessions of the second quarter, and added another touchdown on its next possession in the third. Minster senior quarterback Jared Huelsman led that charge, scoring all three touchdowns on runs inside the 10. The Wildcats also took advantage of four interceptions. “We started to get in a rhythm,” Minster coach Geron Stokes said. “We run some options offense where Jared has the ability to do things with the football that not every quarterback gets to do. He was running our offense.” Huelsman finished with 221 yards rushing on 31 carries. The 6-foot-2, 195-pounder, who won MAC Offensive Player of the Year, also threw for 141 yards and a touchdown on 12-of-20 passing. His only miscues came on Minster’s opening drive with an interception by Cuyahoga Heights’ Alex Studniarz and a one-handed grab by Drummond in the fourth quarter. “You’ve always got to be aware of where he’s at,” Huelsman said.",

      "full": "CANTON, Ohio – Cuyahoga Heights&#x27; return to the OHSAA state football finals ended in another loss Friday morning, as the Redskins fell, 32-7, to Minster in the Division VII title game at Tom Benson Hall of Fame Stadium. The Redskins, ranked fifth in the state, trailed by 12 points going into halftime and were never able to cut the deficit due to turnovers and the versatile play of All-Ohio senior quarterback Jared Huelsman. “Our kids kept battling — kept giving us more opportunities,” said Cuyahoga Heights coach Al Martin. “[Minster is] a great football team. They have a lot of bodies. We were going to have to play great to beat them and call really good plays, and we didn’t do that today; but to make it to the state finals two years in a row from our three communities with 38 guys in the program -- these seniors are incredible.” The opening four minutes of the game featured turnovers by both teams. Cuyahoga Heights junior defender Alex Studniarz came up with interception in Minster territory. Then Minster’s Austin Brown picked off Redskins quarterback Ryan Polk on a fourth-and-3 from the Wildcats’ 11. Brown gave the Wildcats a 7-0 lead five plays later, catching a 44-yard pass from Huelsman with 7:07 left in the first quarter. A Redskins personal foul led to the Wildcats entering Cuyahoga Heights territory. Cuyahoga Heights&#x27; leading receiver Dylan Drummond came up with an answer, hauling in a 28-yard touchdown pass from Polk. The 10-play, 64-yard drive tied matters at 7-7. In the second quarter, the Wildcats capped off a 94-yard drive with a Huelsman 3-yard run. On its next possession, Minster marched down the field in 3:17, and with one second left before halftime, Huelsman punched in the 3-yard score. Minster led 19-7 after a missed extra point. Huelsman finished the half with 120 yards on 19 carries. He had 255 of his game-leading 362 all-purpose yards in the first half.",

      "next_sentence_true": "The 6-foot junior point guard returned for Solon&#x27;s third game and has not lost much of a beat through the Comets&#x27; 69-65 win Friday at Brunswick.",
      "full": "BRUNSWICK, Ohio – The second time Sincere Carry’s basketball season seemed derailed was the easy part. Carry underwent surgery twice this year on his left knee to rectify a bone chip, only to come back in the fall fall and have his right knee suffer a similar fate within a month of returning. This injury also required surgery, but Carry said it wasn’t as serious. The 6-foot junior point guard returned for Solon&#x27;s third game and has not lost much of a beat through the Comets&#x27; 69-65 win Friday at Brunswick. “The first time I got hurt, I was down and didn’t know what I was going to do,” Carry said. “The second time, I had already been through it, so it was easier. I had the support.” Senior Jason Steele and sophomore Michael Bekelja handled most of the point guard duties during scrimmages and the first month of practice. Carry has played four games since his return and averaged 17 points. He provided seven assists Friday with a touch that sparked his teammates to productive nights, including junior guard David Gulley. “Without Sin it’s obviously hard,” said Gulley, who scored 17 points and knocked down four 3-pointers Friday. “He just opens up a lot of open shots.” Solon (5-1) is ranked No. 21 in the cleveland.com Top 25. Its only loss came in Carry&#x27;s return, when he came off the bench for 17 points against No. 9 Medina. The knee injuries didn’t show Friday against Brunswick, as Carry zipped the basketball to teammates with ease. “He’s much improved,” Brunswick coach Joe Mackey said. “He’s a lot more under control and a tough guard. It seems like he’s more of a leader for his team.” Mackey just graduated a longtime starter at point guard in Michael Quiring and matched senior Keith Simmons, a smaller guard against Carry for their Greater Cleveland Conference game. Simmons used his quickness and an outside shooting touch to score a game-high 25 points, but Mackey said his guard still has a way to go. Meeting Carry provided a litmus test. A season ago, Solon reached the Division I regional semifinals at Cleveland State. The Comets made it as a team hovering around .500 before their postseason run. This time around, there is a different swagger around Solon. Coach Tony DeCesare said he has noticed it. So has Carry, a three-year starter. Here is what else stood out Friday night in Northeast Ohio: • A frantic comeback try for No. 5 St. Ignatius ended with Matt Davet&#x27;s 3-point shot clanking off the backboard in a 75-72 loss to unbeaten Canton McKinley.

Brandon Rush paced the Tigers with 21 points, while Sha&#x27;Mar Latham added 20. • No. 12 Benedictine 83, Youngstown Cardinal Mooney 35: The Bengals won their fourth straight game, as senior guards JaMari Patterson (18 points) and Ronnie James (13) led the scoring pace.

Eastlake holds a conference record of 4-0. “We are a long way from that and still have a lot games to be played,” said Eastlake North coach Paul Force.

      "full": "ELYRIA, Ohio — Riley Stopp wasn’t supposed to be the hero, but she was anyway. The sophomore hit a driving layup with 11 seconds to play Wednesday to lead an improbable comeback for Cornerstone Christian, which won a thrilling non-conference battle against host Elyria Catholic, 53-51, in a battle of unbeaten girls basketball teams. The Patriots, 9-0, entered the game ranked No. 7 in the cleveland.com Top 25. Elyria Catholic, 5-1, was ranked No.2. “It was exciting,” Stopp said of her game winner. “I knew we needed one, so I said, ‘Why not?’ I just kind of felt it.” Ironically, the final play was not designed for Stopp, but instead for Michaela Cloonan. But Stopp found herself at the top of the key with a path to the basket. She dribbled once behind her back to beat her defender, and then went hard to the basket. “It really wasn’t for her, but I’m glad she did take it,” said Cornerstone coach Lisa Stopp, Riley’s mother. “We were going for a clear out for Michaela, but Riley saw the angle and finished.” Cornerstone found itself behind, 51-43, with less than four minutes to play. That’s when Lisa Stopp decided to change her team’s defense from their bread-and-butter man-to-man to a 1-3-1 half-court trap. The results were immediate. The Panthers had five possessions against the trap, turning the ball over three times and missing two long three-pointers. Elyria Catholic didn’t score in the game’s final 4:24. “We played some nice basketball throughout the night,” Elyria Catholic coach Eric Rothgery said. “We just failed at the end. We didn’t execute. I give them a lot of credit. They put on that (1-3-1) and they trapped us well. We just held onto the ball too long. Hopefully we learn from it.”",

      "full": "CLEVELAND, Ohio — A football decision shaped St. Ignatius&#x27; season, and maybe Tommy Eichenberg&#x27;s college trajectory. Coach Chuck Kyle knew what he had in the linebacker, who signed his National Letter of Intent on Wednesday with Ohio State during college football&#x27;s early signing period. Eichenberg smiled as he put on the scarlet hat with a gray Block &quot;O.&quot; To his right, center Grant Abbott put on a Bowling Green hat and cornerback Jett Elad fitted himself with an Ohio University cap during St. Ignatius&#x27; ceremony for the trio. Coincidentally, they all made positional adjustments this season. It&#x27;s just that the 6-foot-3, 235-pound Eichenberg moved from outside to middle linebacker just as his college interest elevated from Boston College to Ohio State and Michigan. Not so coincidental to Kyle. &quot;The difference he made against quality opponents who could run the ball, then couldn&#x27;t run the ball against us, that launched the conversations,&quot; Kyle said. &quot;Suddenly, there&#x27;s more talk.&quot; Eichenberg initially committed to Boston College well before his senior season. He had no intention of thinking about college while playing his senior season for the Wildcats, dreaming more about the goal of playing for a state championship and not the one he grew up with as a youngster in Westlake. He admitted Wednesday that he indeed wanted to play for Ohio State long before any college coach or scout knew his name. Even when older brother Liam Eichenberg left for Notre Dame, the Buckeyes tugged at Tommy like so many who grow up playing football in Ohio. The thought of it happening began to materialize a year ago when Urban Meyer visited St. Ignatius. Eichenberg had just made a name for himself as a first-year staring outside linebacker helping the Wildcats nearly make it back to the state finals. Kyle said he received interest, but scholarship offers did not manifest from the Power Five schools. &quot;It seemed like he was on the backburner a little bit, but as this season progressed everything moved to the front,&quot; Kyle said. &quot;Let a kid prove it on the field.&quot; He did: 126 total tackles, eight sacks and 23 tackles for loss. Most of that came after St. Ignatius began this season 0-2 and made the move to push Eichenberg to the middle of its defense. The Wildcats won eight straight games and returned to the playoffs with one of Northeast Ohio&#x27;s top defenses. Eichenberg put off his college decision, including a de-commitment from BC, until after the season. He visited Columbus for the Michigan game and made his decision the following weekend during the Big Ten championship. &quot;After the season, I sat down, tried to figure it out, see where I wanted to go and Ohio State was it,&quot; Eichenberg said. There was some pull for Michigan, too. Longtime friend and St. Edward safety Caden Kolesar, who is headed to Michigan, tried to convince him to pick the Wolverines. Eichenberg couldn&#x27;t get Kolesar to come to St. Ignatius four years ago. He picked St. Ignatius&#x27; equivalent of That Team Over West, so Eichenberg fittingly was not heading to That Team Up North. RELATED: A friendship woven into the St. Ignatius-St. Edward rivalry &quot;He was like, &#x27;Hey, this is the only time we can not be rivals. Come to Michigan,&#x27;&quot; Eichenberg said of a text exchange. &quot;I was like, &#x27;I really like Ohio State, I&#x27;m just going to go there.&#x27;&quot; Ohio State&#x27;s impending coaching change from Meyer to Ryan Day also didn&#x27;t sway Eichenberg. &quot;They&#x27;re both great coaches,&quot; he said. &quot;What really didn&#x27;t change my opinion is what Urban put in place is going to stay with all of the coaches. I really like Ryan Day, too. I didn&#x27;t really care.&quot; Unlike so many college recruits, Eichenberg&#x27;s recruiting surge came late and during his senior football season — not during spring combines in shorts. Kyle noted that is now a rarity. &quot;Are athletes overanalyzed by tests? Yes,&quot; Kyle said. &quot;Look at the film and look at what he does in a game. He certainly showed that.&quot; The move inside helped, too. &quot;When I played outside, I was trying to make tackles way on the other side of the field,&quot; Eichenberg said. &quot;Moving to Mike (football slang for middle linebacker), I could really just go anywhere I wanted and make tackles.&quot; His teammates noticed the difference.",

Harris wasn&#x27;t alone on Tuesday. Senior point guard D.J. Dial initiated Brush&#x27;s offense with 24 points and seven assists. Big 6-foot-9 junior center John Hugley added 16 points and 18 rebounds in front of 13 Division I college coaches. Many might have been there to see Hugley in a marquee matchup, but Dial also showed them his capabilities. Meanwhile, St. Edward took plenty from the matchup of top teams in the cleveland.com rankings — another stern test and second straight loss for coach Eric Flannery&#x27;s Eagles — before a trip to South Carolina for four games in four days between Christmas and New Year&#x27;s Eve. Catch up on more from around the area in this boys basketball rewind. One of Tuesday&#x27;s other premier matchups came in the Lake Erie League between two teams that reached Columbus last season. Top-ranked Lorain, looking to reclaim the Lake Erie League championship after a run to the Division I state semifinals, took a step forward with a 67-59 win vs. D-III powerhouse Lutheran East. Devon Grant led the Titans with 24 points, while Taevon Pierre-Louis added 21 for Lorain (5-0). Sophomore E.J. Farmer paced No. 22 Lutheran East (2-3) with 26 points. Warrensville Heights point guard Ramelle Arnold shined the brightest among Northeast Ohio&#x27;s talented sophomore class on Tuesday, scoring 29 points while leading No. 16 Warrensville Heights to a 73-70 home win vs. No. 14 Cleveland Central Catholic. The Tigers needed all of it from Arnold, as Jordan Duke&#x27;s stingy Ironmen focused on taking away Warrensville standout senior guard Brandon Rush, holding him to two points. Trevon Wells led Central Catholic (3-3) with 21 points, while Arthur Fayne added 17. The Tigers took a 12-point lead into the fourth quarter before holding on for their biggest win of the young season. Don&#x27;t look now, but Padua is 6-1 with a new-look lineup for coach Brian Ansberry. And don&#x27;t call it a rebuild. &quot;We said outside people say it&#x27;s a rebuilding year, but we don&#x27;t use that term because the guys in the program worked too hard to say that,&quot; Ansberry said, &quot; and we have the talent, just a lot of unknown players.&quot; Among them, sophomore Daniel Peterson — younger brother of graduated 6-7 standout Kevin Peterson — who scored 13 points Tuesday in the 54-46 win at up-and-coming Parma. Sam Ehrbar, another sophomore, added 13 points. The Bruins are starting a freshman, too, in Akinlana Popoola, but a trio of seniors — Mikey Morsillo, Nick Frostino and John Monnin — have set the tone. Frostino forced five charges last weekend vs. St. Thomas Aquinas.",

      "full": "EUCLID, Ohio — A long distance barrage from the sharpshooters from Eastlake North was too much for host Euclid to handle Saturday in a non-conference matchup between teams ranked in the cleveland.com girls basketball Top 25. Led by 33 points from junior Destiny Leo, the No. 12 Rangers hit 13 3-pointers — nine in the first half — to roll past the No. 17 Panthers, 81-54, handing the hosts their second consecutive loss at home. North is 8-0, while Euclid falls to 5-3. “I thought it was a great performance by us,” Leo said. “We prepped really well for this game. We knew what their strengths were and what their weaknesses were and we just battled it out.” Leo, who entered the game averaging 28.8 points, hit five 3-pointers. The rest of her points were either on layups or free throws. An all-Ohio player last year as a sophomore, Leo has an exceptionally quick release. She also is savvy enough to get many of her layups on backdoor cuts when her defender over-plays the outside shot. “She’s a special player,” North coach Paul Force said. “She’s unique in the way that she prepares. She’s unique in her mental makeup. A lot of girls are skilled, but she doesn’t waver. It doesn’t matter if she misses some shots, it doesn’t matter if someone wants to try to put a hand in her face. She trusts her teammates, she trusts the system. She had a special game in a big moment tonight.” Leo was backed by sophomore Abby Carter with 17 points and senior Madelyn Hammond with 16. Hammond, who averages about eight points per game, hit four threes, two free throws and a layup, all in the first half. With Leo and Hammond leading the way, the Rangers built leads of 19-13 after one quarter and 47-28 at the half. “We want to be in attack mode, and if they close on us, we’ll kick it out and take what they give us,” Force said of the long-range shooting. “We knew they had a size advantage on us, so we wanted to take some of their size away from the basket by taking some outside shots. Later in the game they took out the post, so I think that strategy was effective.” The Panthers came out battling in the third quarter, forcing turnovers and scoring the first seven points of the period to make it 47-35. However, that was the closest the Panthers would get. “My hat’s off to them,” Euclid coach Lynn Phillips said. “They’re fundamentally sound, they were knocking down shots, getting fast breaks. We just didn’t take care of what we do. We didn’t execute well. We came out in the third and had a little spark to start off but, you know, we can’t trade twos for threes.” In many ways, that was the story of the night. In addition to their explosive scoring, the Rangers clamped down on defense, employing a hybrid set that was very aware of Euclid’s leading scorers, Constance Chaplin and Alexus Reese. For much of the game, Carter guarded Chaplin one-on-one, while the rest of the team focused on covering Reese on the block, in a kind of box-and-one set. Chaplin finished with 19 points, but she had to work for every one of them. Reese ended with 10 and Myah Goodman came off the bench to hit five threes for 15 points. “We wanted to put a lot of emphasis on (Chaplin) and (Reese) because they’ve been averaging close to 50 points per game,” Force said. “We wanted to make the other girls beat us. Some of them stepped up for them and made some big shots, but at the same time, I told the girls at halftime that, in my opinion, it’s not those other girls who win games for Euclid.”",

      "full": "CLEVELAND, Ohio — Every game worries Solon coach Tony DeCesare, but returning Saturday night to his alma mater came with struggles his boys basketball program has not experienced in more than a year. Just a night earlier, the Comets dropped their first Greater Cleveland Conference game against Euclid. Next came an undefeated St. Ignatius boys basketball team with DeCesare&#x27;s squad desperate to pull itself up after a 1-3 start. Solon&#x27;s desperation showed, and it left Ohio City with a 77-71 win in overtime. The victory snapped a two-game streak for Solon (2-3), the No. 7-ranked team in the cleveland.com Top 25. Going back to last weekend, it dropped an overtime game at Benedictine. &quot;Both of those were one possessions,&quot; DeCesare said of the Benedictine and Euclid losses. &quot;Both of those, we felt like if we had done some things better, we would have come away with wins.&quot; Those two experiences helped Solon on the road Saturday vs. No. 9 St. Ignatius (3-1). Senior guard and Fairmont State recruit Mike Bekelja and Tiffin-bound Trent Williams led the way. Both three-year starters, returning from last season&#x27;s Division I state final run, shouldered the scoring load down the stretch. Bekelja scored a game-high 28 points, while Williams added 23. Every one of their points were needed through regulation and overtime, as St. Ignatius led for most of the first three quarters. Junior guard Chase Toppin paced the Wildcats with 24 points. Senior center Kevin Davet used his 6-foot-8 frame to score 16 points, grab 13 rebounds and block four shots. Thunderous dunks by him and 6-6 sophomore Henry Raynor sparked the Wildcats early.

Sonny Johnson wasn&#x27;t the only freshman to see Friday at Garfield Heights.

      "full": "LAKEWOOD, Ohio — In Lakewood&#x27;s four games so far, only one team has scored more than 40 points against it. Granted, St. Edward does things to teams most cannot. Since a lop-sided loss to open the season, Lakewood has focused on its defensive work that was on display Friday in a 44-40 win against Olmsted Falls. In the Southwestern Conference, where possession-by-possession grinds are the norm, a special attention must be made on that side of the ball to have success. Lakewood knows that well after sharing last season&#x27;s SWC crown with Olmsted Falls. Here from the Rangers, including senior forward Zion Kolodynski-Darby, junior Nate Mims and coach Alex Cammock in the above video. Olmsted Falls coach Chris DeLisio assessed his team in the video below. Catch up on more from around the area in this boys basketball rewind. Villa Angela-St. Joseph technically is not called the Ironmen, but coach Babe Kwasniak&#x27;s Vikings put together a performance fitting of an ironman title. Only six players reached the floor in VASJ&#x27;s 80-78 overtime win vs. Archbishop Hoban. The Vikings rallied from nine points down in overtime and remained without injured senior guard Jordan Calhoun, yet sophomore Jaden Hameed put together a 29-point night to preserve their first North Coast League win of the season. As for the Ironmen by name, VASJ get them next in a trip next Friday to Cleveland Central Catholic. Shaker Heights transfer Kevin Bishop had his biggest game since joining Benedictine, scoring 23 points in the Bengals&#x27; 83-69 home win vs. Central Catholic. The effort kept Benedictine undefeated and handed the Ironmen their first loss of the season. Bowling Green commit Davin Zeigler added 21 points, as Benedictine jumped out to an eight-point lead early and maintained it the rest of the way. Sonny Johnson wasn&#x27;t the only freshman to see Friday at Garfield Heights. Jonathan Effertz supplied St. Ignatius with 18 points, complementing senior Lukas Bielek&#x27;s 19 points, and the Wildcats left with a convincing 68-58 win that kept them undefeated. St. Ignatius took control with a 25-point third quarter, and the Bulldogs could not recover in falling to their third defeat. Demetrius &quot;Meechie&quot; Johnson Jr. led the hosts with 21 points, followed by 16 from Brison Waller and 12 by Sonny Johnson. Roderick Coffee III scored 20 points, while Bishop Thomas added 18 in Harvey&#x27;s 74-43 win at Chagrin Falls.

He has Goessler in his starting lineup for a fourth straight season, and Brunswick is off to a 3-0 start. The point guard initiated the Blue Devils&#x27; 74-53 home victory Friday night to open the Greater Cleveland Conference vs. Shaker Heights. With it, the coach got a glimpse of what the future could entail. His son, Trevor, is still just a junior. But he also has a new sophomore standout in Tre Massey, who provided a career-high 32 points and hit eight of Brunswick&#x27;s 13 3-pointers. Massey moved over from neighboring Strongsville, where he played as a freshman and helped the Mustangs to a district final run. Arriving from a rival could have been difficult, but Massey said he has felt welcomed. Mackey and Goessler conferred on that embrace. &quot;First time Tre came in, we all liked him already,&quot; Goessler said. &quot;He&#x27;s been huge for our team.&quot; The shooting performance they put on Friday mimicked what they experienced in scrimmages and the preseason. See how it came together in the above video. Hear from Mackey below on what his trusty senior point guard still means to the program, and catch up on boys basketball around the Greater Cleveland area in this rewind. SHAKER HAS ROOM TO GROW Shaker Heights junior Dakota Cochran played his best game of the young season, but inexperience showed at Brunswick. Coach Danny Young shared his thoughts on a team that is mostly a new look beyond Cochran after last season&#x27;s regional tournament run. East Tech honored 13th-year coach Brett Moore amid Friday&#x27;s 88-52 home victory vs. John Marshall for securing career win No. 200. It happened Sunday at Cleveland Heights during the Great Lakes Classic. The opponent: Warrensville Heights, which was ranked 10th in the cleveland.com preseason Top 25. Moore was presented Friday with a game ball, signed by each player. He shared the experience on his team&#x27;s Instagram account. &quot;Getting offensive-minded players to believe in their defensive capabilities is a beautiful sight,&quot; he wrote. &quot;Watching your team mature at halftime is even more rewarding. Motivation comes from within.&quot; East Tech is 4-0, following a 22-point effort Friday from D.J. Harrell, 17 from Philip Byrd and 13 by Johnny Bigsby. Those three also were in double figures when the Scarabs took down Warrensville for their early signature victory. Their next game is Tuesday at Rhodes, which is on the upswing in the Senate League with college prospect Amarion Dickerson, a 6-foot-5 sophomore forward, and freshman Jamal Sumlin to go with returning starters Marlon Landingham and Quinton Flanagan. The Senate, as a whole, could be on the upswing. Glenville has a mostly new roster after winning the league last season with a senior-laden squad. The Tarblooders won their season opener against Willougby South and moved back above .500 on Friday with an 81-49 win at John Hay. Sophomore Bryon Ottrix scored 27 points in that one. Cuyahoga Valley Christian Academy coach Jay Peters picked up his 300th win Friday in the Royals&#x27; 52-34 win vs. Western Reserve Academy. Trey Williams led CVCA with 13 points. Brettly Carroscia added 12. Thursday, Cleveland Heights coach Michael Cruz hoped to save Jae&#x27;Lyn Withers for St. Ignatius. But with Withers nursing an injured ankle, Cruz called on him in the fourth quarter of a 53-52 loss at Villa Angela-St. Joseph. Withers played much more Friday night, but the Wildcats withstood the 6-foot-8 Louisville recruit and scored a second big win to start the season. They opened a week ago at Cleveland Heights&#x27; Great Lakes Classic with an 80-73 win vs. Lutheran East, followed by Friday&#x27;s 61-59 win vs. the Tigers, with 6-8 senior Kevin Davet scoring 12 points while junior guard Chase Toppin and Griffin Hanna added 10 each. Withers led Heights with 21 points, while Manny Hill added a career-high 17 points. For the second straight night, Cruz&#x27;s Tigers could not get a clean look at a final shot. Here is a look at the last two days. Here&#x27;s a look back at VASJ&#x27;s 53-52 win Thursday against Heights. Coach Babe Kwasniak said afterward he did not think his team could have played worse and still won against such a quality opponent.

Sometimes we&#x27;re known for letting guys get record nights.&quot; The coach chuckled about that. His team, ranked 22nd in the area, dropped its second straight game after a season-opening win vs. Buchtel. Brunswick coach Joe Mackey said he scouted that Buchtel game, a double-digit blowout win for the Red Raiders (1-2) and worried about them just as much as Young worried about Goessler. &quot;I left there thinking they were one of the top 10 teams in the area,&quot; Mackey said. &quot;This was a really quality win for us.&quot; Junior Dakota Cochran led Shaker with 16 points, including two vicious dunks, and 6-2 junior guard Shammah Scott added 14 points. Cochran&#x27;s second dunk pulled Shaker within four points early in the third quarter, but the Blue Devils answered with a 14-point run. That 36-32 difference ballooned to 50-32 after three, with Massey knocking down a deep 3 in front of the student section. &quot;We&#x27;re all a unit.

Those open shots early led to more driving lanes as the game wore on. Goessler racked up seven assists and eight rebounds. All but one of Brunswick&#x27;s 13 treys came off assists, a welcomed sight after a double-digit win vs. Highland and two-point victory against Wadsworth. &quot;We had a few scrimmages where we were really hot,&quot; Goessler said. &quot;The first two games, we weren&#x27;t shooting the ball as well as we knew we could. Tonight, everyone was spraying it. We have a lot of good shooters on this team.&quot; Mackey knew he had one in Goessler and his son, Trevor Mackey. He also knew what to expect from Massey, having played Strongsville twice per season in the GCC. Now, the coach is certain more people around Brunswick are aware of him. &quot;We don&#x27;t get many move-ins here,&quot; Mackey said. &quot;I think I&#x27;ve had two or three in 23 years.

The program finished 12-30 in Hall&#x27;s four seasons and won just one game this season, a 34-33 thriller against Southwestern Conference rival and playoff contender North Olmsted. He took the job in January 2015 after a seven-season run in Massillon and had numerous stops in Northeast Ohio. Hall said Friday in a statement that he has settled in at Westlake and expressed a desire to watch more of his daughters, who are high school and middle school athletes. &quot;I just feel that, at this time in my life, this is a decision I need to make for my family,&quot; he said in the statement provided by the school. &quot;I still intend to be active with our coaches and athletes, helping our athletic department in any way I can.&quot; Hall did not take a break after his run at Massillon, which included six playoff appearances in seven years. He also had stops at Ravenna Southeast, Brush and Nordonia. In 17 seasons, he has a 107-84 career record. Hall will remain a health and physical education teacher at Westlake. He also will serve as a faculty manager, assistant athletic director Tony Cipollone. &quot;He has helped to build a solid foundation on which the football program can continue to grow,&quot; Cipollone said. &quot;I look forward to working with him in his new role as we continue to develop our overall athletic program.&quot;",

      "full": "BRUNSWICK, Ohio – In Solon coach Tony DeCesare&#x27;s six seasons on the boys basketball staff, Brunswick has not been a kind place. That changed Friday with the Comets&#x27; 69-65 Greater Cleveland Conference win at Brunswick, a first in DeCesare&#x27;s three seasons as head coach or the other three as an assistant. “For our team and program, this was a big step,” DeCesare said. His Comets (5-1), currently ranked No. 21 in the cleveland.com Top 25, have played in Brunswick for holiday tournaments and GCC games. He has seen double-digit comebacks fall with tip-ins at the buzzer, no wins against Brunswick and maybe one in a holiday tournament. That is why he relentlessly paced the sideline as Solon’s lead hovered near 10 points in the final minute. It was not enough for him against the No. 24 Blue Devils (4-3), who once trailed by 16 points. “It’s been tough,” junior guard David Gulley said. “Coming out here taking an L year after year, it was good to get this streak over with.” Gulley and junior point guard Sincere Carry each scored 17 points. Gulley knocked down four 3-pointers, and Solon built its two-point lead with a stronger second quarter. Three of Gulley’s 3-pointers came in the first half. The Comets hit six in that stretch and finished with nine. “Once I saw the first one go in, it was a confidence booster,” the 5-foot-10 Gulley said. “I knew I was going to hit a lot.” Carry added eight assists and broke down Brunswick’s defense in his fourth game back from a knee injury. “He’s a game changer,” DeCesare said. “He lets everyone else kind of just fill their role and he can get baskets when he needs to. He’s an emotional leader for our guys and one of the best players in the area.” Having Carry back to orchestrate the Comets also helps end their frustration in Brunswick. Blue Devils coach Joe Mackey said he brought that up with his players before and after Friday’s game. “This is our third loss, and all have been at home,” he said. “Last year we didn’t lose at home. It hasn’t been the home-court advantage we would have liked.” Senior point guard Keith Simmons scored a game-high 25 points to lead Brunswick. He also added seven assists, but the Blue Devils were plagued by 15 turnovers to just nine for Solon. Mackey’s crew will get two chances next week to change its home-court fortunes with its own holiday tournament on Dec. 29 and 30. The Blue Devils will face Nordonia, plus Padua or Marysville. They return to GCC play Jan. 3 against Medina.",

That definitely factored into the decision.&quot; Withers had four points, two blocks and two rebounds in his limited action. He gave Cleveland Heights its first lead since early in the first quarter on a pull-up jumper past the elbow of the paint. Heights&#x27; lead grew to four points before Khalil Mitcham&#x27;s putback after a Withers block, and VASJ found a way to scrape out a victory. The Vikings retook the lead on Hameed&#x27;s corner 3-pointer in the final minute. VASJ coach Babe Kwasniak said he considered removing Hameed before that stretch because of his injury problems. &quot;I said, &#x27;You know what? No matter what happens, this is something he can put in the back of his head,&#x27;&quot; Kwasniak said. &quot;To hit that shot, man!&quot; Neither team added another point for the final 40 seconds. Cleveland Heights&#x27; final shot ended on a corner baseline jumper that Waag got a hand on, and Latrace Jackson pulled down the errant shot. The final seconds ticked off the clock, as VASJ&#x27;s students and fans mobbed Jackson and his teammates. Kwasniak said he did not think his team could have played any worse and won. &quot;If we&#x27;re not playing at home, we probably don&#x27;t win,&quot; he said. &quot;If their stud plays the whole time, we probably don&#x27;t win.&quot; But VASJ got a spark at the right times from its sophomore guards, Waag and Hameed. It also had the leadership of Koppelman and Mitcham, who finished with 13 points and 12 rebounds. Every little thing added up in VASJ&#x27;s favor. Especially a raucous home crowd that packed its gym. &quot;I can&#x27;t remember the last time the atmosphere was like that,&quot; Kwasniak said. &quot;You know what won that game? Being in the tile, not just the tile, but the Viking community won that game. There&#x27;s nowhere else we could have played that game and won.&quot;",

So Wadsworth settled down, turned up the defense and proceeded to outscore the Bulldogs, 43-23, for the remainder of the game. The 53-43 victory gives Wadsworth an early claim at the No. 1 spot in the area with a 3-0 record (2-0 in the Suburban League National Division) while Stow falls to 1-1 overall and in league play. “Their wheels were spinning way too fast,” Booth said. “We gave up some things in that first quarter that we normally don’t. I think once we settled down on the defensive end that also slowed us down on offense. I thought we made some very rushed decisions with the ball in the first quarter. Obviously, in the second, third and fourth quarter we did a much better job of slowing ourselves down.” Of course, there are always two sides to a story, and Stow coach Bob Podges had a slightly different take on things. “After the first quarter it seemed like we took it for granted,” he said. “We didn’t play the way we typically play, which is certainly a lot harder and a lot smarter than what we did tonight in the last three quarters.” Lilee Carlson and Emily Andrassy led Stow with 15 and 14 points, respectively, but 10 of Andrassy’s points came in the opening period. In addition, Lizzy Stefanov, who is headed to Tulane to play volleyball and also could reach 1,000 career points this basketball season, was held to just two points on two free throws. When asked if it was the Wadsworth pressure defense that caused the offensive problems, Podges said no without hesitation. “I blame my own team,” he said. “Their defense was very good, but they didn’t do anything that surprised us. We just started bailing out on things instead of being mentally strong enough to run what we needed to run.” Stow scored the first basket in the second quarter to make it 22-12, but Wadsworth proceeded to run off 11 consecutive points to take its first lead. A late flurry gave the Bulldogs a 27-25 halftime lead, but it didn’t last long. Stow went cold for much of the third quarter, failing to score for more than six minutes. In the meantime, five players scored for the Grizzlies during a 13-2 run that put the score at 40-31 after three quarters. Stow fought back to cut it to three at 44-41, but then the Bulldogs were outscored, 9-2, the rest of the way. Kylee Batey led a balanced attack for Wadsworth with 12 points. Kacie Evans added 11 points and 13 rebounds, while Taylor Leatherman and Maggie Long each had eight points. So, the question is, just how big a game was this, especially since it came so early in the season and the teams will play each other again in February? “You hate that it’s played this early,” Booth said. “You wish it was at the back end of the first round. But that being said, I think it’s a huge game. Stow is one of the favorites in the league. For us to protect home court in the first half of the round robin is huge. Maybe more than anything, I think our confidence had been growing, but we have even more confidence with this outcome.” The teams tied for the league crown last year, with each winning on the other team’s home court. So Stow knows it will have another shot at Wadsworth. “It’s a good barometer for us,” Podges said. “We certainly saw a lot of evidence of what we need to work on as a team in order to play, particularly offensively, at the level we need to play at as the season winds down.”",

      "full": "CLEVELAND, Ohio — Urban Meyer redefined recruiting for Ohio State, but Ryan Day is no stranger despite not having been in Columbus that long. Those were the sentiments Tuesday from a few area high school football coaches who have interacted with both men, leading up to Ohio State&#x27;s announcement that Meyer will retire after the Rose Bowl and Day will be his replacement. &quot;I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s going to hurt anything,&quot; said Archbishop Hoban coach Tim Tyrrell, whose team is coming off its fourth straight OHSAA state title and has Division I college recruits up and down his roster. Ryan Day recruited Hoban and has known Tyrrell since his days at Boston College. Tyrrell said the difference from Meyer and Day are their personalities. While Meyer&#x27;s demeanor can leave some in awe, Tyrrell said Day might be a little more personable. &quot;Maybe he&#x27;s not as iconic, so it&#x27;s easier for the high school coaches to talk to him,&quot; Tyrrell said. That might not be good or bad for Ohio State in terms of recruiting, but just different. The high school season wrapped up Saturday in Canton with the state championships. As of that time, the Buckeyes had three Northeast Ohio standouts in their sights: Tyrrell is sending prized left tackle Nolan Rumler to Michigan next year, but Trayanum is one of Ohio&#x27;s top prospects — and one of its most versatile — at running back, linebacker and safety. The Hoban coach does not expect Ohio State&#x27;s coaching change to sway his players one way or another. &quot;Our kids didn&#x27;t bat an eye when it went down,&quot; Tyrrell said. Some of it has to do with who is recruiting them, and it rarely is just Meyer. When Ohio State showed interest in Cleveland Heights&#x27; Jaylen Harris at receiver or Tyreke Smith at defensive end, it sent assistants Tony Alford and Larry Johnson. They developed vital relationships before Meyer ever made his visits to the school or home to close the deal. &quot;Obviously Urban Meyer left a huge imprint, but Larry Johnson and Tony Alford did a great job of recruiting the Northeast Ohio area,&quot; Cleveland Heights coach Mac Stephens said. &quot;But again, I think it&#x27;s Larry Johnson and Tony Alford embracing Urban Meyer&#x27;s philosophy.&quot; Alford recruited Harris, while Johnson developed a relationship with Smith that led to his commitment. Stephens met Meyer on his recruiting trips to Cleveland Heights, and said Meyer&#x27;s sincerity stood out. &quot;It just felt real,&quot; Stephens said. &quot;It wasn&#x27;t fake.&quot; In the world of football recruiting, Stephens said he has seen plenty of pitches that lacked a heart-felt conviction. &quot;With some coaches, I can pretty much tell what the sales pitch is going to be before it comes out of their mouth,&quot; he said. &quot;They come in and talk about the different uniform combinations or what their student services are like.&quot;",

By halftime, St. Vincent-St. Mary — the No. 1-ranked team in the cleveland.com preseason Top 25 — battled SPIRE to a 30-all tie. STVM coach Dru Joyce took no moral victory, despite it. Everything unraveled for the Fighting Irish (1-1) as a defensive press led to a flurry of 3-point makes for the basketball academy based in Geneva. Watts, a Michigan State commit, led SPIRE with a game-high 27 points and four 3-pointers in the second half. Three of them came in the fourth quarter, as a six-point difference ballooned to 20. &quot;That&#x27;s what they were waiting for,&quot; Joyce said. &quot;They wanted the game up and down. We were fine when we kept it in the half court, but we missed easy shots. &quot;When you miss those shots against a team like that, it hurts because I have to do something I don&#x27;t want to do. I have to come up and press them.&quot; The game began with a deliberate pace, just as Joyce ordered up. The first two quarters ended with the score tied. Jackson blocked about a six shots in the first half and, when he wasn&#x27;t in position to make that play, left a lasting effect that forced those easy misses near the rim that Joyce lamented. While Watts joined SPIRE this summer after being considered Michigan&#x27;s top prospect in the Class of 2019, Jackson had the same billing from that state in the 2019 class. They carried much of the load for SPIRE, as Ball tried to distribute and make plays without the ball.",

He limped around the floor in the later stages, but SPIRE coach Jermaine Jackson dismissed it as him being tired. Ball&#x27;s presence is what attracted a crowd that sold out the lower bowl at the field house for an event put on by the Scholastic Play By Play Classics, which will host its annual showcase in January at Elyria Catholic. On the attention Ball has brought, Jackson said, &quot;We handle it the same way we handle everybody. We all embrace each other and try to go out there and impose our will.&quot; They did in a late stretch that was highlighted by consecutive dunks from Ball and Isaiah Jackson.",

The Cardinals (5-0), ranked No. 8 in the cleveland.com Top 25, switched their pressure into a 2-2-1 to start the second half. That adjustment led to a 17-2 run to start the second half and forced seven Bay turnovers in the third quarter. Mentor outscored Bay, 28-9, in the third quarter. “The big difference was they had to earn every shot,” Krizancic said. “They had way too many good looks in the first half. I thought defensively, that’s why we got a lot of transition buckets. That’s why the good third quarter.” Mentor forced 20 turnovers and committed just 12. Eleven different Cardinals scored led by Jack Korsok’s 17 points. Caden Kryz added 13, and Xavier Cheek and Manning Trubisky each scored 12. The Cardinals grabbed the lead for good early in the first quarter with an 11-0 run. They led by as much as 13 in the first half before No. 19 Bay (6-3) cut it to three at halftime. “We weren’t rotating on the press. We should have picked off a lot of those 30-, 40-foot lobs, and they’re getting great 3s,” Krizancic said. “We were just slow reacting.”",

      "full": "MEDINA, Ohio – On a night in which Medina remembered Sierra Bland, a friend from eighth grade paid tribute the best way he could. Bland, a 17-year-old who attended Medina High School, died Dec. 13 after a battle with ALS. Her funeral was Monday. On Tuesday, the school held a moment of silence before its boys basketball game against Maple Heights. Students wore blue shirts that read &quot;Sierra Strong.&quot; And Ben Geschke sank a 3-pointer at the buzzer to give them all a 72-70 win to distract from the somber mood. As the 6-foot-1 senior guard celebrated with friends and teammates on the court, he paused. Bland, a classmate in eighth grade, remained on his mind. “I’m not sure if she’d remember me,” Geschke said, “but I knew her.” Medina coach Chris Hassinger, also a physical education teacher, and an assistant had Bland in classes. “She was just a great kid,” Hassinger said. “She was kind-hearted and loving. You wonder if she’s not looking down on us and giving us a little bit of an extra oomph to make that play.” That last play kept Medina, ranked ninth in the cleveland.com Top 25, unbeaten at 5-0. No. 15 Maple Heights (5-1) lost its first game in what second-year coach Eric Schmidt said is the Mustangs&#x27; best start in at least a decade. Schmidt also lamented his team’s 9-of-16 free-throw shooting. Maple Heights point guard Marcus Kimmie just missed the front end of a one-and-one to set up Medina’s final chance. Geschke asked Hassinger in the huddle if he could play off the ball and take the last shot with his team down a point. So Hassinger drew up a plan that began with Luke Schaefer inbounding from the far sideline to Tyler Kaminski on a quick give-and-go. Medina had just 4.9 seconds to make this play work, and Schaefer plowed his 6-4 frame toward the top of the 3-point arc before deferring to an open Geschke on the right wing.",

      "full": "AMHERST, Ohio – The Amherst and undefeated Berea-Midpark girls basketball teams, both leaders in the Southwestern Conference, squared off on Saturday for the first time. Amherst made some key plays late in the game to take a 49-39 win. Amherst, ranked No. 17 in the cleveland.com Top 25, never trailed No. 16 Berea-Midpark in their first conference meeting. “We knew this was a big one,” said Amherst coach Kevin Collins. “Berea is the team to beat in our conference, so we had to come out and play our best. We really challenged the girls all week. Our goal is to win the conference and we knew if we wanted to get to that goal tonight was the first step.” Early in the game, Berea-Midpark (6-1, 6-1 SWC) used its size as an advantage to slow Amherst (6-1, 5-1 SWC), but also struggled to score. The conference rivals combined for only 32 points in an intense first half, with Amherst holding a 20-12 edge. Sophomore guard Kamryn Dziak and junior guard Kate Iliff led Amherst each scored six points while senior post Miranda Otero paced Berea-Midpark with six. The Titans trimmed the deficit to three, generating turnovers and out-rebounding Amherst, but still trailed 27-23 at the end of the third quarter. With the Titans continuing to struggle on offense, the Comets had a 22-16 edge in the final quarter. Senior guard Sydney Roule, signed to Indiana University-Purdue University at Indianapolis, scored 12 of her 16 game points in the fourth and shot 7-of-8 from the free throw line. Berea-Midpark never led. “We didn’t make a lot of shots and Amherst had a lot to do with it,” Berea-Midpark coach Kevin Braaten said. “Amherst’s defense was very solid and I think as the game wore on we lost a little confidence offensively. They hit a lot of timely shots and we could never hit that big shot to get us over the hump.” Senior guard Jayla Hall and Illif each finished with 11 for Amherst. Otero ended the game with eight points, eight blocks and 19 rebounds. Junior guard Jasmine Kinsey chipped in with eight points, followed by junior Mya Johnson and junior Lexie Scarton each with seven. The Titans were without junior guard Jada Marone, on a coach’s decision. She’s averaging 14.6 ppg through five games.",

      "full": "CLEVELAND, Ohio – Football postponed the start of the boys basketball season for both Archbishop Hoban and Benedictine. That didn&#x27;t bother Hoban on Friday night, as the No. 16 team in the cleveland.com Top 25 left Cleveland with a 53-51 win against the eighth-ranked Bengals. Junior guard Collen Gurley scored a game-high 22 points, while senior forwards Cartier Bickley and Brian Cuppett each reached double figures in the North Coast League road win. Two weeks ago, three rotation players suited up for Hoban’s state football championship. Garrett Houser was on the receiving end that day and most of the fall. But now as a junior point guard, he found teammates to start the fourth quarter and push the Knights (3-1, 1-0) NCL Blue Division) to a vital victory. “It’s been hard, but I’m slowly getting my groove back,” said Houser, who scored three points and dished out six assists. “It’s definitely been a harder transition than last year.” Houser characterized himself as exhausted the last two weeks, yet he pushed Hoban for two early baskets in the fourth quarter that helped his team seize control in the close game. Hoban never led by more than six, but coach T.K. Griffith will take it. His team took down Benedictine (1-1, 0-1 NCL Blue Division), which played without 6-foot-5 senior standout Marlon Moore because of an ankle injury. “We’re still theoretically shorthanded,” Griffith said. “We’ve got guys coming back from football, so we don’t know what we’re doing totally. We’ve had four games in seven days.” Benedictine, meanwhile, played just its second game in two weeks. The Bengals&#x27; Dec. 2 season opener against St. Ignatius was postponed because of its football team playing a state championship game that night. Even when coach Rob Stricula&#x27;s bunch got on the floor last Friday, it came against Central Catholic&#x27;s JV team because 15 varsity players served a suspension from their opener. “Everybody’s fighting to find themselves and we’re really selfish right now,” Stircula said. “The last three weeks have been really bad. I was expecting this.” A month ago, Stircula felt confident amid preseason practices and scrimmages. “We had a good summer,” he said.",

      "full": "CLEVELAND, Ohio – A four-year battle with colon cancer took the life of Rhodes baseball and football coach Phillip Gary on Wednesday. Gary, who was an accomplished math intervention specialist, died at the age of 57. A couple of days before his final football game on Nov. 5, Gary informed his school athletic director that he would need to take some time off for health reasons. Gary recovered from Stage 4 colon cancer in 2012, but the symptoms returned for the longtime head coach and teacher. Rhodes athletic director Cheri Dzuro shared that story nearly a month and half later. “He knew when he left school his days were numbered,” said Dzuro. “He was humorous, passionate and very dedicated. Even to the end he came in every day.” Gary started coaching football at Rhodes in 2003 and became an assistant baseball coach two years later. Eventually, he took over the baseball team in 2009 left after by current John Hay head coach Tim Hogan. The baseball team continued to flourish since the program started in 1989. Last year, Gary led the baseball team to a second consecutive Senate Athletic League championships -- once against Lincoln West and the other against John Hay. “He was a great guy and I recommended he take the program because I thought he could keep it at a high level,” Hogan said. The Rams appeared in every championship game since Gary started as an assistant in 2006. Since 2009, Gary has won four league championships while the four titles went to Lincoln West. “You could see those guys [at Rhodes] loved him and he loved them,” former Lincoln West coach Tim Casselberry said. “With baseball, it’s kind of a funny thing because it’s laid back, but that wasn’t Phil’s way. He was intense and it carried over to his players.” Crestwood baseball coach John Bakalar added, “He had a really good team. He was a really good guy, really personal and it’s an unfortunate loss.” Gary, who is a native of Cleveland, started with the area&#x27;s school system in 1994 and coached football at Collinwood as an assistant. Gary left to become the head football coach at Sandusky in 2001 after four seasons as the head coach. He would return to Cleveland to head up the Rhodes program two years later. Gary was diagnosed with stage 4 colon cancer in 2012. A year later he returned as head coach. Glenville football coach Ted Ginn Sr. sympathized with Gary after battling pancreatic cancer during the same time. The two shared their thoughts between their football games. “I was as sick as he was,” Ginn said. “We were both at the sick at the same time and we always talked about how we were blessed to be back coaching football. That was a tough road and I don’t know how we made it through.” Ginn added, “Gary was very disciplined, stern and strong minded guy. He loved football, loved the discipline of it and loved the kids.” “He used football to build to children,” Ginn said. “To lose a legend like that in the city that is major.” Lincoln West football coach and Rhodes teacher Brooks Baird added, “I’ve known Phil for years and it’s very sad. He was a tremendous role model for our students and adults. He’s going to be missed and he’ll be in our thoughts.” In what would be Gary’s final year, he led the Rams (6-5) to the Senate Athletic League championship in November, but fell to John Hay in overtime, 19-16. “It was a bittersweet game because we won, but I also know that it was his last game coaching,” John Hay football coach Rodney Decipeda said. He added that before the season finale, he spoke with Gary about his coaching future and noticed his weight loss.",

      "full": "<i>By Libby Hill, Los Angeles Times (TNS</i>) It’s been 14 months since Kevin Spacey retreated from the public eye after facing myriad accusations of sexual assault. On Monday, the Oscar-winning actor reintroduced himself with an odd video amid news that he would face criminal charges in a 2016 case of alleged sexual assault. The Boston Globe reported Monday that Spacey was scheduled for arraignment on a charge of indecent assault and battery at Nantucket District Court on Jan. 7. The incident in question took place in July 2016 and allegedly involved the actor groping the genitals of an unwilling 18-year-old. Spacey raised eyebrows Monday with his ill-fated return to social media for the first time since his apology to Anthony Rapp and official statement coming out as a gay man in October 2017. On Twitter and Instagram, the “Usual Suspects” actor shared a link to a YouTube video featuring Spacey delivering a three-minute monologue in character as his former “House of Cards” protagonist, Frank Underwood. Except Frank Underwood was killed off between Seasons 5 and 6 of the hit Netflix series after Spacey was unceremoniously dismissed after numerous accusations of sexual misconduct came to light. In Monday’s video, titled “Let Me Be Frank,” Spacey spoke directly into the camera, as was Underwood’s wont, and bemoaned his current state of affairs. But the line between Spacey and the character remained fuzzy, as he eviscerated those who wished to see him confess and lambasted others who rushed to judgment without facts. “We’re not afraid, not of what we said, not of what we did and we’re still not afraid,” Spacey said, ostensibly as Underwood. “Because I promise you this: If I didn’t pay the price for the things that we both know I did do, I’m certainly not going to pay the price for the things I didn’t do.” Representatives for Spacey did not immediately respond to The Times’ request for comment. Reps for Netflix said the company had no comment. If you purchase a product or register for an account through a link on our site, we may receive compensation.

      "full": "NEW YORK — In a flood of new releases, “Aquaman” easily swam past “Mary Poppins Returns” and “Bumblebee” to lead the busy pre-Christmas weekend with an estimated $67.4 million over the weekend, according to studio estimates Sunday. Without a &quot;Star Wars&quot; film on the December schedule for the first time in four years, a crowded slate of films sought to capitalize on the lucrative holiday period in theaters. The DC Comics superhero film &quot;Aquaman,&quot; which cost Warner Bros. $200 million to make, arrived already a juggernaut overseas, where it has grossed more than $400 million in three weeks of release. Including advance previews, the Jason Momoa-led &quot;Aquaman&quot; reeled in $72.1 million in U.S. and Canada theaters, bringing its global total to $482.8 million. &quot;Aquaman,&quot; directed by James Wan, has proven to be a stabilizing &quot;Justice League&quot; spinoff for Warner Bros. following bumpier DC releases outside of &quot;Wonder Woman.&quot; The film garnered an A-minus Cinemascore from audiences. For the studios, the weekend was as much about setting themselves up for Christmas to New Year&#x27;s, when theaters are routinely packed through the week. With Christmas falling on a Tuesday, studio executives said the weekend was an unpredictable and distraction-filled one, competing with some of the busiest shopping days of the year. &quot;We really kick off starting Tuesday,&quot; said Warner Bros. distribution chief Jeff Goldstein, who said the &quot;Aquaman&quot; performance came in just above the studio&#x27;s $65 million forecast. &quot;With kids not really returning to school until January 7, this aligns the stars for us in a really positive way.&quot; Returns were more modest for Disney&#x27;s &quot;Mary Poppins&quot; sequel and Paramount&#x27;s &quot;Transformers&quot; spinoff, though each had reason to expect strong business through the holidays. &quot;Mary Poppins Returns,&quot; starring Emily Blunt and directed by Rob Marshall, debuted with $22.2 million over the weekend and $31 million since opening Wednesday. That was on the low side of expectations for the musical, which cost $130 million to make. &quot;May Poppins Returns,&quot; which co-stars Lin-Manuel Miranda, will depend heavily on legs through the holiday season. On its side are good if not spectacular reviews (77 percent fresh on Rotten Tomatoes), an A-minus CinemaScore from moviegoers and four Golden Globe nominations. &quot;It&#x27;s a great weekend to start yourself off on a launch pad into the holiday period,&quot; said Cathleen Taff, head of distribution for Disney. &quot;We&#x27;re looking forward to great word of mouth building over the next few weeks. And we&#x27;re looking forward to a long run.&quot; &quot;Poppins&quot; still narrowly edged &quot;Bumblebee,&quot; which opened with $21 million. That, too, is a soft beginning for a film that cost about $135 million to make after tax credits. It&#x27;s also far off the pace of the &quot;Transformers&quot; films, the last of which (&quot;Transformers: The Last Knight&quot;) debuted with $44.7 million in summer 2017. But &quot;Bumblebee,&quot; a &quot;Transformers&quot; prequel directed by Travis Knight and starring Hailee Steinfeld, has something the Michael Bay films never had: good reviews. &quot;Bumblebee&quot; was the weekend&#x27;s most acclaimed new wide release with a 94 percent fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Audiences also gave it an A-minus CinemaScore. &quot;The pre-Christmas preoccupation for moviegoers affected everyone. All movies were impacted slightly by that,&quot; said Kyle Davies, head of distribution for Paramount. &quot;It doesn&#x27;t concern me. We played really well with great reactions. The game plan has always been that we&#x27;re now starting that play period where people go multiple times over the next few weeks, and that&#x27;s the whole point.&quot; &quot;To me, this weekend was a dress rehearsal for the big push that starts Christmas Day,&quot; added Davies. Also in the mix is Sony&#x27;s well-reviewed &quot;Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse,&quot; which slid to fourth in its second week with $16.7 million in ticket sales. The film also made one of the best debuts for an animated release in China where it was no. 1, grossing $26.1 million over the weekend. Clint Eastwood&#x27;s &quot;The Mule&quot; added $9.3 million in its sophomore frame, bringing its two-week total to $35 million. Bradley Cooper, who co-stars in &quot;The Mule,&quot; could also celebrate his &quot;A Star Is Born&quot; crossing $200 million domestically. Largely overlooked in the onslaught at theaters was STXfilms&#x27; &quot;Second Act,&quot; starring Jennifer Lopez. The romantic comedy debuted with an estimated $6.5 million in 2,607 locations, drawing an audience that was 70 percent female. But the weekend&#x27;s real flop was &quot;Welcome to Marwen,&quot; the Robert Zemeckis-directed fantastical drama starring Steve Carell as an imaginative man whose scale model town helps him rehabilitate after a trauma. The film, which cost at least $40 million to make, earned just $2.3 million in 1,900 theaters. It&#x27;s the second straight flop for Universal (which teamed with DreamWorks for &quot;Marwen&quot;) following &quot;Mortal Engines.&quot; That $100 million film debuted last weekend with $7.5 million film in ticket sales. Yet the weekend managed to nearly equal the box office of the same weekend last year when &quot;The Last Jedi&quot; was in its second week of release and &quot;Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle&quot; opened. Ticket sales for the &quot;Star Wars&quot;-less weekend were down a mere 2.1 percent, according to Comscore. Year to date, the domestic box office is up 7.5 percent and was expected to just eke past 2016&#x27;s record $11.38 billion sometime late Sunday or early Monday, said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for Comscore. &quot;The collective and cumulative strength of these newcomers, particularly &#x27;Aquaman,&#x27; and a huge slate of holdovers gave us a stronger weekend than anyone imagined,&quot; Dergarabedian said. &quot;A superhero movie in December can make up for not having a &#x27;Star Wars&#x27; movie in December.&quot;",

Over the past year, syracuse.com&#x27;s vintage page has introduced readers to a variety of interesting characters from the region&#x27;s past, a group of individuals who for an instant became part of their region&#x27;s story, both good and bad. Here are some of the year&#x27;s most fascinating vintage characters from the past year. <i>Copyright 2004 Heritage Microfilm</i> <b>Charles Mason Mitchell</b> Few in Syracuse history packed as much into their life as Charles Mason Mitchell. Before his death in 1930, at the age of 71, Mitchell was a Broadway actor, world traveler, big game hunter, served in Theodore Roosevelt&#x27;s Rough Riders during the Spanish-American War and was a diplomat to countries around the globe. He also fought with the Canadian army, campaigned for Teddy Roosevelt, discovered two new species of animals and survived an assassination attempt. In 1915, while in Syracuse to visit his mother while acting as American Consul to German Samoa, the Post-Standard said Mitchell had &quot;squeezed more adventure into his life than most men have ever dreamed.&quot; <i>Copyright 2004 Heritage Microfilm</i> <b>Mary Pryor </b> Could Mary Pryor have been Upstate New York&#x27;s meanest ever teacher? Her behavior was so bad that in April 1928, parents  in Kirkland, N.Y., a suburb of Utica, were telling their children to stay home and ended up dividing the town. The shocking allegations leveled at the 15-year teaching veteran included: failing to provide children drinking water or use of the bathroom, whipping a student with a rubber hose and telling a female student that &quot;she didn&#x27;t know anything and will never learn anything.&quot; Despite negotiating for an extra $10 a month to act as the school&#x27;s janitor, Pryor often made the students perform the tasks around the school. After a hearing, Pryor was allowed to keep her teaching license and New York&#x27;s commissioner of education censured Kirkland&#x27;s parents. <i>Copyright 2004 Heritage Microfilm</i> <b>John Smith, Watertown&#x27;s most married man</b> John Smith was a Watertown hospital orderly, who, in September 1928, married Miss Helen Clark, a nurse he met at work. &quot;It was a beautiful wedding,&quot; the Syracuse Herald said, &quot;and it was duly chronicled in the newspapers. Smith did object to the publicity - at the time.&quot; But the wedding announcement would be his undoing and in the coming weeks, three other Mrs. John Smiths came forward, visiting him in the hospital while he was battling mastoiditis, a painful infection inside the ear. Why was he married to four women at once? &quot;I can&#x27;t even tell you. I suppose I&#x27;ll have to go over the road for it. I know I did wrong when I married the second woman, but I had no self-control. I couldn&#x27;t resist the temptation. I have no judgment where women are concerned.&quot; Charged with bigamy, his lack of self-control landed him two-and-a-half to five years of hard labor at Auburn Prison. <i>Cover of the book &quot;The Wonderful Leaps of Sam Patch&quot;</i> <b>Sam Patch, America&#x27;s First Daredevil</b> Sam Patch was America&#x27;s first daredevil and for a very short period in 1829, one of its most famous citizens, second only to maybe Davy Crockett. Born in 1807 to modest origins, Patch worked at cotton mills in New England and soon found he was very good at jumping into the water from tall distances. He was a braggart, an exhibitionist and a natural showman. His signature catchphrase, &quot;Some things can be done as well as others,&quot; became a slang expression used across the country. In October 1829, his popularity soared after he became the first person to successfully dive into Niagara Falls. But something went horribly wrong a month later at the Genesee River near Rochester and Sam Patch lost his life at the age of 22. <i>Library of Congress</i> <b>Mary Shannon Webster</b> The year 2018 saw the 100th anniversary of the end of First World War. After the United States entered the war, Syracuse joined the rest of the country and did its part. One of those to volunteer was Mary Shannon Webster, the granddaughter of one of Syracuse&#x27;s first war heroes. &quot;Camouflaging&quot; her age, Webster volunteered at Camp Syracuse and then worked as a Red Cross Canteen girl in France. Her letters back home were published in the Herald and gave readers a first-hand account of life in Paris during the Great War. She packed bags for the soldiers, made sandwiches, served officers, including General John Pershing and had her heart broken following the death of her soldier boyfriend. She served until the end of the war and came home proud of what she did: &quot;I have just had the most wonderful time. I am so glad and proud of having had the privilege to be over there. I wouldn&#x27;t have missed the experience for anything.&quot; <i>Copyright 2004 Heritage Microfilm</i> <b>The actress, the Common Council President, and the Sheik</b> In the autumn of 1923, Syracuse was rocked by the kind of tabloid scandal that one would associate with New York City, Hollywood or Washington D.C. It involved an actress, Rita Knight, her husband, a former Common Council President with a very famous last name, George Crouse, and the handsome first baseman of the local baseball team, who was nicknamed the Sheik, because of resembled Rudolph Valentino. An affair between the actress and the baseball player, begun after an almost fairy-tale meeting at Star Park, was exposed by the aggrieved husband, after he sent his private investigators to spy on his wife. The newspapers at the time pounced and presented wall-to-wall coverage of the story with both sides smearing the other. After their divorce, both remarried. <i>Submitted by Tormey family</i> <b>Mary Tormey, dance censor</b> In 1923, with Prohibition in effect, leaders of Onondaga County next wanted to crack down on the amount of &quot;salacious&quot; dancing going at dance halls in the suburbs of Syracuse. Enter Mary Tormey, Onondaga County&#x27;s dance censor. Born in Ireland in 1864, Tormey was the first female deputy sheriff in the United States and the perfect choice to lead such a crackdown. Arriving at a dance hall she was bombarded with &quot;cat calls, guffaws, hisses and a vehement razz.&quot; Men called for her to be thrown out. But she stood in the middle of the dance hall, arms crossed, and pointed out &quot;bad behavior,&quot; then told the dance hall managers they would be held responsible if they did not put an end to it. The Syracuse Journal reported in July 1923 that the &quot;vigilance&quot; of the &quot;bobbed-haired woman deputy&quot; had taken a lot of the &quot;jiggle out of the jazz dances.&quot; <i>Syracuse Journal, 1938</i> <b>Lawrence Gough, Cedar Chest Killer</b> Syracuse has had its share of horrible criminals over the years, but few can match cold-hearted brutality of Lawrence Gough, the Cedar Chest Killer. Gough, a sometime waiter and short-order cook, was dating pretty hairdresser Laura Krenrich in 1938 when an argument over Memorial Day weekend ended in her murder. After Krenrich told him she had many possible suitors, Gough struck Krenrich with a metal pipe and stuffed her body in a cedar chest and left it hidden a closet. Before escaping to the south, he sold Laura&#x27;s clothes, spent two days with Laura&#x27;s family lying to them about her whereabouts and asked to borrow money from the dead woman&#x27;s brother and mother to help pay for his escape.",

      "full": "As most stores close their doors on Dec. 25, those who don&#x27;t celebrate Christmas are left with few options for entertainment and food. Two such options stand out among the rest: Going to the movies and eating Chinese food. Searches for Chinese food every year at Christmas, and many people say they look forward to this as a favorite -- and delicious -- &quot;Christmas&quot; tradition. Others love spending the day at the theater, choosing popcorn over fortune cookies. Which is your favorite? Chinese food has become a ritual for those not celebrating Christmas, and according to CityLab, it&#x27;s one that&#x27;s existed since the 1930s. Claire Tran and Nichole Javorsky report: Chinese cuisine is a Christmas tradition in its own right, and one shared among many. Meanwhile, going to the movies has also become a favored Christmas tradition. Whether your celebrate Christmas or not, going to the movie theater is a great way to spend time with friends or family and to eat up hours of the day. <br/> When asked on Reddit: &quot;How many people actually go to the movie theatre on Christmas day?&quot; one user responded: Another added: Even Supreme Court Justice Elena Kagan acknowledges the beloved Chinese food tradition. As The Atlantic&#x27;s Adam Chandler puts it: Going to the movies is the perfect low-key activity that still keeps the family together and enjoying one another&#x27;s company. Let&#x27;s be honest, after the presents have been opened and the hot chocolate has been sipped, you have the whole day ahead of you to do ... what? If you don&#x27;t have relatives or friends coming over, there isn&#x27;t much to do other than watch &quot;A Christmas Story&quot; on repeat. Your time is much better spent watching the next Oscar-nom in the theater.",

Well, not everyone; some critics are worried the film will ruin their &#x27;90s childhood and love for the original film. But the standalone sequel does hold a 77 percent fresh ratingon Rotten Tomatoes. Still, some argue just the thought of this film is disrespectful to Robin Williams&#x27; legacy. What do you think?

Washington Post&#x27;s Jane Horwitz writes: Who doesn&#x27;t want to see a praised action comedy starring Dwayne Johnson and Kevin Hart? Come on, now. Some critics argue the film is basic though.

Parsnip fries, radish chips, and sesame-ginger carrot noodle stir-fry are just some of the highlights. For many, no matter how hard they try, vegetables will never taste like the real thing. Replacing a burger bun with mushrooms is a crime-pizza crust made from cauliflower, an abomination. It&#x27;s all about treating your body right. Carbs aren&#x27;t the enemy; you just have to monitor your intake of them. If you want Subway for lunch and pizza for dinner-do it! But if you can replace some of those starchy carbs with vegetable alternatives, why not? As Emily Lunardo points out for Bel Marra Health: Take advantage of the many nutrients in vegetables and enjoy your pizza. Knowing exactly which carbs to eliminate from your diet is exactly why there is no reason to replace them with vegetables. Opt for brown rice instead of fried. Go for sweet potato fries instead of french fries (y&#x27;know they taste better anyway!). Simple, daily decisions like these can make a huge difference in your overall health.

      "full": "Zucchini noodles. Cauliflower pizza crust. Broccoli rice. Is this a trick, or is this the future? Some people love these new-age carb substitutes, saying they allow healthy eaters to still enjoy their favorite meals and flavors. But most people say that the veggie-subs are just not the same; pasta isn&#x27;t pasta if it&#x27;s made out of squash. What do you think? As the world becomes more health-conscious, more people are opting for veggies instead of bread. But when you&#x27;re addicted to pizza or can&#x27;t live without rice, sacrificing your favorite meals is a high price to pay for cutting calories. Thankfully, you now have some healthy alternatives in the form of vegetable-based ingredients. Greatist&#x27;s Rebecca Rirkser outlines some of these creative and mouth-watering recipes. Parsnip fries, radish chips, and sesame-ginger carrot noodle stir-fry are just some of the highlights. For many, no matter how hard they try, vegetables will never taste like the real thing. Replacing a burger bun with mushrooms is a crime-pizza crust made from cauliflower, an abomination. It&#x27;s all about treating your body right. Carbs aren&#x27;t the enemy; you just have to monitor your intake of them. If you want Subway for lunch and pizza for dinner-do it! But if you can replace some of those starchy carbs with vegetable alternatives, why not? As Emily Lunardo points out for Bel Marra Health: Take advantage of the many nutrients in vegetables and enjoy your pizza. Knowing exactly which carbs to eliminate from your diet is exactly why there is no reason to replace them with vegetables. Opt for brown rice instead of fried. Go for sweet potato fries instead of french fries (y&#x27;know they taste better anyway!). Simple, daily decisions like these can make a huge difference in your overall health.

His beliefs change about Christmas and last for a lifetime. The Nutcracker in Harlem by T. E.

Marie is very shy, attending a large Christmas party with her big family that has music, dancing and singing provided by her uncle Cab. She loves Christmas and is encouraged to sing at the party, but has no confidence and sleeps under the tree with her nutcracker drummer boy gift from her uncle. Through a dream, she stops a battle between the soldiers and the mice by playing the nutcracker&#x27;s drum to scare the mice away.

      "full": "<i>Michael Greenlar</i> When you think of good sparkling wines, you may immediately think of Champagne, or perhaps Prosecco. But quality bubbly doesn&#x27;t have to come from France or Italy, (or the U.S. West Coast, for that matter).  The Finger Lakes is becoming better known for its &quot;sparklers,&quot; the spritzy wines that take center stage at the end (and start) of each year. It makes sense when you consider that Champagne, the region that gives its name to the famous French sparkling wine, is France&#x27;s northernmost wine area. Like the Finger Lakes, Champagne produces &quot;cool climate&quot; wines. That&#x27;s why one of the Finger Lakes most renowned wineries, Dr. Frank, started making sparkling sparkling wine as far back as 1980. &quot;The cooler climate is not a barrier in (the region of) Champagne,&quot; said company president Fred Frank in a 2013 syracuse.com interview. &quot;Why should it be a barrier here?&quot; <i>David Lassman</i> We asked three Upstate New York wine experts to recommend some sparkling wines to celebrate New Year&#x27;s 2019. Our experts were: -- Torrey Grant, fine wine coordinator at Liquor City in DeWitt (and instructor of a wine studies course at Syracuse University). -- Bob Madill, industry liaison for the Finger Lakes Wine Alliance and wine director of Kindred Fare restaurant in Geneva. -- Nick Palermo, assistant manager at Maximum Wine & Liquors on Route 11 in Cicero. Each recommended three New York sparkling wines. None picked the same wine, and only the Dr. Frank winery had two wines on the list. That illustrates the growth in New York&#x27;s sparkling wine industry, Grant said. &quot;Sparkling wines continue to show the diversity of wine grapes and styles that can be grown with success in the Finger Lakes,&quot; he said Photo above: Bottling sparkling wine at Dr. Frank Winery near Hammondsport.

Wiemer Cuvee Brut 2013 $29.99 Recommended by Nick Palermo at Maximum Wine & Liquors, Cicero:  &quot;This sensational sparkler is 65 percent Chardonnay and 35 percent Pinot Noir, and the influence of those two varietals comes shining through in the form of bracing notes of green apple and citrus. Dry, with plenty of grip on the palate and a long-lasting finish -- a fitting example of exactly what NYS has to offer with its sparkling wines.&quot; Dr. Konstantin Frank, Celebre NV (Keuka Lake) $17 Recommended by Torrey Grant at Liquor City in DeWitt: &quot;Made from 100 percent Riesling this sparkling wine is one of the many expressions of Riesling being produced in the Finger Lakes that defies the grapes mistaken reputation for being made only in sweeter style wines. Made in the traditional method this brut (generally the driest style seen on local shelves) has all the flavors and aromas found in cool climate Riesling. Green apple, apricot and hay combined with the yeasty autolytic notes from the in bottle fermentation and prolonged contact with yeast.&quot; Swedish Hill Blanc de Blanc $13.99 Recommended by Nick Palermo at Maximum Wine & Liquors: &quot;Derived entirely from the Cayuga White grape, ... this semi-dry sparkler offers a silky smooth palate, enriched with intricate notes of apples and lemons.

The 6&quot; x 5&quot; calendar has tear-off pages and can hang on a wall or sit on a desk. Winter is coming—and so is the epic final season of <i>Game of Thrones</i>. The battles, betrayals, and bloodshed get underway in April. If someone on your list is obsessively streaming the first seven seasons of <i>GoT</i>, treat them to a glass etched with one of the show’s classic quotes: “That’s What I Do. I Drink and I Know Things” for Tyrion Lannister fans, “Mother of Dragons” for Daenerys Targaryen fans, and so on. Choose stemless and tulip wine glasses, Old Fashioned glasses, pint glasses, or a flask. Incidentally, GoT lovers will have no need to drown their sorrows when the “game” is finally won. Talks are already underway for spinoffs. Can you think of a better reason to raise a glass? Here’s the perfect stocking stuffer for Walter White devotees. Sweet, sugary blue rock candy crystals come in a trio of “confiscated” four-inch plastic test tubes, each printed with Walter’s well-known phrase “Respect the Chemistry.” They’re tucked inside a mock ABQ police department evidence bag for added authenticity—which anyone “addicted” to the 16 Emmy–winning <i>Breaking Bad</i> is sure to appreciate. A must-have for fans of the much-beloved prequel to <i>Breaking Bad</i>, this ceramic mug is stain resistant and microwave/dishwasher safe. It also makes a great desktop pen holder if the giftee isn’t a coffee/tea lover. The black-and-yellow design features a sublimely tacky, retro-style ad for <i>Better Call Saul</i> protagonist Jimmy McGill’s future alter ego—Saul Goodman, <i>Breaking Bad</i>’s criminal lawyer with the emphasis on “criminal.” This trio is just what every <i>TWD</i> fanatic needs to perch atop the computer, bookshelf, counter, or dashboard. The highly detailed collectible mini zombies (“walkers” in <i>TWD</i> parlance) are made of resin and measure four inches tall. They’re equipped with adhesive pads to keep them in place, lest they wander off in search of human flesh to devour while their new owners are in a blissfully zombified state watching <i>TWD</i>. Treat the <i>Friends</i>-aholic friend or relative in your life to their own replica of the iconic frame that hung on the inside of Monica and Rachel’s (later Monica and Chandler’s) apartment door. Handmade of resin, the frame measures 10” tall by 8” wide from one outer edge to the other. This charming imitation set piece comes with adhesive tape strips for easy hanging on the front door, the bedroom door, or anywhere your <i>Friends</i>-obsessed recipient chooses to display it. These thick, cozy wool crew socks will keep feet warm during binges long enough to rival a first-year surgical resident’s shift—and with 15 seasons of the multi-award-winning show and counting, there’s plenty of material for a marathon. The socks are available in five color variations, including light and dark gray, pink, purple, and blue. If you can’t find your favorite TV addict’s guilty pleasure on the list, why not give a gift to satisfy every binger’s craving? Order them a 12-month subscription to a streaming service.

      "full": "It&#x27;s impossible to walk around a show like the annual Syracuse Nationals and not pick out cars that you covet, or cars like those you, your father or grandfather owned in years past. I do it all of the time, and I know many others do, too. The question is, do people flock to the show for the spectacle, or to allow themselves to be taken back in time by thousands of dream machines? I suspect for many visitors it&#x27;s a little of both, dreaming of cars from the past, but reveling in the thousands of sights and sounds, too. Since we&#x27;re at the halfway point between the 2018 show and the upcoming 20th anniversary 2019 Syracuse Nationals, it&#x27;s a good time to share a few cars that drew my interest during the 2018 show. In all cases, and dozens more, I was attracted to these cars for their workmanship and beauty, as well as their sentimental value. And in the interest of full disclosure, one of the cars, a 1958 Pontiac Chieftan two-door hardtop, was previously featured on Syracuse.com, and in The Post-Standard, but I&#x27;m including it because when I was a kid my father had an identical Chieftan. <i>Kenn Peters</i> <b>1951 Fleetline Chevy</b> Albert Mastrota, of Wilmington, Del., brought this 1951 Fleetline Chevy lead sled to the show, finished in flat paint, old school style. The car is elegant in its own way, and Albert said it&#x27;s a pleasure to drive. He&#x27;s owned it for 15 years. <i>Kenn Peters</i> <b>1968 Pontiac LeMans</b> This beautiful 1968 Pontiac LeMans s owned by Bill Kline, of Whitesboro, N.Y. This car was a project, to say the least, because it underwent a frame-off restoration that took eight years from beginning to end. And Bill has owned the car for only 10 years. Such classic touches on this car, especially the white interior, which is something you don&#x27;t see anymore. <i>Kenn Peters</i> <b>1956 Chevy Nomad</b> A 1956 Chevy Nomad is always nice to see, but this particular one, built by father-daughter team, Jerika and Chris Hepler, of Oil City, PA., is particularly stunning. The restoration took them eight years, but they did it right and saw to every detail, including installation of a fuel-injected 327 cubic inch V-8 engine. <i>Kenn Peters</i> <b>1970 Buick Electra 225</b> Anthony Jones, of Syracuse, owns this 1970 Buick Electra 225, commonly referred to in the day as a deuce-and-a-quarter. Anthony has owned this car for five years and has kept it in beautiful shape. What makes this car interesting is the fact that 1970 was the final year for an Electra convertible. While the &#x27;70 ragtop was the last one, it had the first 455 cubic inch, 370-horsepower V-8 engine. <i>Kenn Peters</i> <b>Rolls Weight</b> Here&#x27;s something you&#x27;ll never see again, a Rolls Weight rat rod. That&#x27;s what Mark Wright, of Clyde, N.Y., calls this home built car, which sports an authentic looking Rolls grille, but is actually a grille he built. The engine is a V-8 from a bus, and the gas tank holds 42 gallons. This car is large, but well designed and built. <i>Kenn Peters</i> <b>1949 Chevy pickup</b> Ron Powers, and grandson, Lucas, 8, of Port Byron, N.Y., brought two cars to the show, a 1949 Chevy pickup, sporting a 350 cubic inch V-8 crate engine, and a 1962 Chevy Impala SS, with a 475-horsepower, 409 cubic inch engine. The pickup, as you can see, has custom touches from a shave grille to custom wheels. <i>Kenn Peters</i> <b>1962 Impala SS</b> This 1962 Impala SS, was also brought to the show by Ron Powers and Lucas, and it is brimming with custom work, much of it nestled under the hood. A few of the goodies include the period correct 409 475-horsepower engine, Edelbrock aluminum heads, Pertronic electronic distributor, a factory-correct dual quad intake. <i>Kenn Peters</i> <b>1967 Chevrolet Camaro RS/SS</b> If you were to see this 1967 all original Chevrolet Camaro RS/SS, in person, you&#x27;d probably ask when it was restored? Well, it was painted in 2010, the original Mountain green. This numbers matching car is owned by Leon and Caleb McCarthy, of Baldwinsville, N.Y. Although Caleb is still too young to drive, it&#x27;s certain that the car will still be in beautiful condition when he&#x27;s old enough. It has the 350 cubic inch, 295-horsepower engine, a Muncie M20 4-speed transmission, the Rally Sport package, This car began life in Long Beach, CA., and now 71,480 miles later it&#x27;s better than ever in Baldwinsville. <i>Kenn Peters</i> <b>1953 Ford Victoria</b> David Capitano, of Webster, N.Y., and his 1953 Ford Victoria, finished in authentic Flamingo Red with Sungate Ivory. This car is pretty much stock, although the 110 horsepower Flathead V-8 has had some minor work and now produces 140 horsepower. <i>Kenn Peters</i> <b>1970 Oldsmobile Vista Cruiser</b> This spectacular 1970 Oldsmobile Vista Cruiser represents nearly five years of work by owner Steve Bicker, who said he did everything on the car including the paint. <i>Kenn Peters</i> <b>1958 Pontiac Chieftan</b> This spectacular 1958 Pontiac Chieftan, is owned by Bob Conniff, of Camden, N.Y. The car is finished in Tropicana and Graystone White, one of the popular Pontiac two-tone combinations that year. Bob recalled that when he was a kid his father, then a Pontiac dealer, took the family to Michigan for the 1958 new-car introductions. The kids remained behind while Bob and his wife went to get a sneak peek at the new cars. Bob said his father raved about the 1958 Pontiacs when they returned, and even drew a picture of what they looked like. <i>Kenn Peters</i> <b>1956 Mercury Monterey</b> Wilmer Weaver, of Fredericksburg, Pa., has owned this 1956 Mercury Monterey for 26 years, but it was only restored recently. He said the original owner of the car passed away and the man&#x27;s wife gave it, yes, gave it, to the gas station where it had been serviced for years. Wilmer was in the right place at the right time to buy the car. <i>Kenn Peters</i> <b>1957 Chevy Bel Air</b> This is Patti&#x27;s 1957 Chevy Bel Air two door sedan. Patti and Jim Salisbury, of East Greenbush, N.Y., brought their just finished &#x27;57 restoration to the Nationals, and this may have been my favorite car of the show. It&#x27;s awesome. Patti said they bought the car in 1982, in pieces and worked on it until 1986 and then took a break until 2012. Once they got back to work they continued until the Wednesday before the Syracuse Nationals began on Friday July 20. In case you&#x27;re wondering, the color is 2002 Corvette Electric Blue. <i>Kenn Peters</i> <b>1932 Ford truck</b> Here&#x27;s another car that&#x27;s original, a &#x27;32 Ford, owned by Al Liebmann, of Kinnelon, N.J. Al has only owned by the car since 2015, and he said there&#x27;s no problem driving it anywhere. With what is popularly known as a patina on the finish, the Ford proudly displays all of its battle scars, but for some reason everything on this car looks right.",

If you see corded drills purchased at Sears in the early ’80s or, even worse, some battered Ikea handy kit, pay very close attention to the list that follows. There is no one who couldn’t find a way to enjoy this small revelation. I thank my late stepfather for passing the magic on to me. Deceptively underwhelming at first glance, this little wand extends to 25 inches and allows you to lift up to three pounds. When you’re done using a claw bar to pry nails out of the cabinet trim, you’re likely to notice a few have landed on the kitchen floor. Instead of getting down on all fours with a flashlight, extend this tiny tool and just sweep it around the work area. As tiny nails fly at the head, you will feel all the power of the advanced human brain mastering the elements. You can also watch it magically occupy a toddler as an easy stand-in for Harry Potter’s wand. For $5.26 on Amazon, this will make you a master of the Smart Arts. I remember the first time I used the drill in this set. A friend handed one to me to secure a screw in a wall stud before I could grab my corded Craftsman (circa 1991) to do the job. I leaned in, as usual, to put all my heft into getting that screw in tight—but there was no need. It whirred into place effortlessly. Suddenly, I knew how Superman felt taking flight for the first time or casually lifting a car above his head. And that was before I’d put my hands on the even-more-powerful impact driver! There’s nothing wrong with hand-me-down tools and it’s never a bad idea to keep a corded fossil for a rainy day. But once you’ve tried the power and felt the ease of doing a job with either the drill or the impact driver included in this set available for $149 at Amazon, you’ll realize that sometimes it’s worth keeping up with what’s new. There are many reasons you’re (probably?) not driving a 1976 Gremlin (forgive me if you are). Newer vehicles are better on gas, keep you safer, and make you more comfortable while you drive. Likewise these two marvelous tools in a perfectly sized bag. They let you work more safely and efficiently because they’re easier to handle, more powerful and better accessorized. OK, let me stop you before you start. Your vociferous Aunt Petunia the woodworker sees another DeWalt tool and wonders—what do you have against Makita? Not a thing, Aunt Petunia. But if you happen to buy the DeWalt drill set above, you’re going to find yourself with two 20-volt batteries that give you the option to buy this jig without spending money on a third battery. That means you currently spend $108.99 at Amazon, instead of almost twice that price. As for the choice of a cordless jig saw, I can say that it’s a versatile and powerful tool that’s much less scary (and risky) than a circular saw and more compact that a table saw. This can do most of the jobs the semi-handy might take on without endangering life and limb. (Really: do take safety seriously and know your resident handyperson’s limits). Did that last warning get you concerned? Want to be sure that you don’t have blood on your hands or anyone else’s?",

Destiny USA officials said Losani didn&#x27;t think he would be granted permission to film at the mall, but Destiny USA was excited to welcome the group, said Director of Marketing Nikita Jankowski.

Giudice served nearly a year in prison, then completed the rest of her sentence on home confinement until Feb. 5, 2016. Joe Giudice is serving a 41-month federal prison sentence for bankruptcy fraud at FCI Allenwood. He scheduled to be released on March 14, 2019. Last month, a judge ordered that Joe Giudice be deported to Italy after serving his prison sentence. He has appealed the order, according to NJ.com. Teresa Giudice arrived in Syracuse Sunday night and stayed at the Embassy Suites by Hilton hotel at Destiny USA. She&#x27;s been documenting her trip to Syracuse on her Instagram.",

How else to explain the robust popularity of &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; which celebrates its 175th anniversary this year? Or &quot;It&#x27;s a Wonderful Life,&quot; now 72 years old? These classic stories remain dear to us because they&#x27;re rooted in a time and a place that we look back on fondly.

The tale of a how a Macy&#x27;s store Santa goes on trial in an effort to prove he&#x27;s the real jolly old elf himself works because it&#x27;s a product of an era in which crowds flocked to department stores, face-to-face retail was king, and kindness could still save the day.

In her program notes, director Bella Calabria writes, &quot;I&#x27;ve decided to set this &#x27;Miracle&#x27; in present day. The message is timeless.&quot; Maybe, but the script -- based on the film and adapted in 1982 by Mountain Community Theater in Santa Cruz County, CA  -- is ho-hum. In updating the story to a contemporary setting, the adaptation loses the protective sheen of nostalgia. Other weaknesses: the characters retain tone-deaf, outdated names like Fred Gailey; the dialogue is maudlin; and the pacing painfully slow even for 1982, a world that had seen the debut of MTV and its frenetic quick-edit style a year earlier. Simple and at times boring, the show is often licensed to middle schools/high schools for student productions.",

But he wasn&#x27;t the most romantic thing in the Turning Stone Event Center Friday night. That title goes to the man who proposed to his girlfriend while Legend sang &quot;Ordinary People.&quot; Her excited shrieks would have been disconcerting had the flash from the waiting photographers not provided enough light for the crowd to see what was going on and offer a hearty round of applause. Don&#x27;t worry, she said yes. The newly-engaged couple stood in the aisle and slow-danced the rest of that song and the next, the more idealistic &quot;You & I (Nobody in the World),&quot; which Legend sung as home videos of Legend, his wife, the cooking entrepreneur, model and social media superstar Chrissy Teigen, and their two kids played behind him. It&#x27;s easy to just sing about love--well, easy if you have a voice like John Legend, one of only 15 people to ever win an Emmy, Tony, Oscar and a Grammy--but he goes above and beyond in making the audiences feel the emotion he pours into his music. Before singing &quot;Slow Dance,&quot; Legend encouraged the crowd to fill the aisles and do just that. But he had no one to slow dance with, so he invited one lucky woman on stage to dance with him. It took her a minute to work through the stage freight and put her arm around Legend&#x27;s waist, but she eventually did, fulfilling a fantasy surely shared by many in attendance. Toward the end of the song, Legend dropped to a knee, grabbed her hand, looked her in the eyes and sung to her. That stage fright kicked back in, but can you blame her? Jenna, you were a good sport. &quot;My shows are known to be aphrodisiacs,&quot; he said with a sly chuckle, because he knows it&#x27;s true. The show was part of the accompanying tour for his Christmas album, &quot;A Legendary Christmas,&quot; which debuted in late October. But even the Christmas music, especially the original songs, weren&#x27;t immune from Legend&#x27;s signature romantic touch. The stage&#x27;s backdrop transitioned to &quot;JL&#x27;s Juke Joint&quot; for &quot;Merry Christmas Baby,&quot; a bluesy number that had Legend loosening his slim neck tie and hitting low notes with a throaty howl that you don&#x27;t often hear from him. Fellow originals &quot;Wrap Me Up In Your Love&quot; and &quot;No Place Like Home,&quot; which Legend performed while sitting at the piano while donning a velvet smoker&#x27;s jacket--Legend&#x27;s wardrobe choices throughout the evening were as sharp as his voice--were upbeat R&B tunes that would be great any day of the year. It seems like just about every big-time musician in the &#x27;60s and &#x27;70s released at least one Christmas album. Now it&#x27;s something of a dying art--we love our classic carols, but do we really need yet another rendition of &quot;Jingle Bells&quot; or &quot;White Christmas?&quot;",

      "full": "By the late 1970s, punk rock&#x27;s initial fiery burst had run out of fuel in England. The motley assortment of musicians who had revitalized rock music with pounding chords and raw vocals had either imploded, like the Sex Pistols, or were bulldozing off into new musical terrain. Elvis Costello slapped slick production and keyboards on the sound, helping to shape New Wave. Joy Division and Wire turned their music into canvasses for ambitious art projects. The Clash were set to fill stadiums with anthems that drew on reggae and dance hall. By the decade&#x27;s end, punk didn&#x27;t sound like punk anymore. But the band that arguably left the biggest mark on punk rock became legends not by changing the format but sticking to the basics of pop. Buzzcocks, a Manchester four-piece, blasted into the scene in 1978 with a pair of albums that would rank among the genre&#x27;s greatest achievements. It&#x27;s a legacy that deserves a second look following Thursday&#x27;s news that Pete Shelley, the band&#x27;s songwriter and guitarist, had died at 63 of a suspected heart attack, as the BBC reported. Shelley and the Buzzcocks&#x27;s melody-friendly take on the music set the stage for both the alternative rock that defined the 1990s, as well as the pop-punk and emo that still reigns today. Without the band, there would likely be no Pixies or Nirvana, Blink-182 or Paramore. &quot;Buzzcocks pretty much invented a style that would influence multiple generations of lonesome hearts and weirdos,&quot; Green Day frontman Billie Joe Armstrong wrote on Instagram on Thursday. &quot;Never shy about writing beautiful melodies into loud fast punk.&quot; Shelley - born Peter McNeish - was a student at what is now the University of Bolton in Manchester, when he and another student named Howard Trafford read a review of the first Sex Pistols show in 1976, according to the Independent. The friends went to see the revolutionary act, and immediately started what would become Buzzcocks. Although the band played their first shows opening for the Sex Pistols, their style was not a carbon copy of the music Johnny Rotten and company were using to shock the establishment. The band played with the same frantic amphetamine energy as their early punk cohorts. But the Pistols screamed about anarchy and violence ripping through the street. The Clash railed about geopolitics. Shelley, however, belted out anthems of frustrated love and romance with titles like, &quot;What Do I Get?&quot; and &quot;Ever Fallen in Love.&quot; The music was also anchored in catchy melodies that were directly influenced by the Beatles. And the singer&#x27;s high-pitched voice was a direct contrast to Joe Strummer&#x27;s bark or Rotten&#x27;s acid screech. Buzzcocks still managed to spark controversy with their music. The band&#x27;s first single, &quot;Orgasm Addict,&quot; was banned from the airwaves by the BBC due to the tune&#x27;s overt sexual message, according to Allmusic.com. The blackballed single only raised Buzzcocks&#x27;s profile among punk fans. In 1978, the band released two full-length albums - &quot;Another Music in a Different Kitchen&quot; and &quot;Love Bites.&quot; But the band&#x27;s 24-track singles compilation released in 1979, &quot;Singles Going Steady,&quot; would go down as the Buzzcocks&#x27;s definitive statement. The furious pace of recording and touring wore down the band members, causing Shelley and Buzzcocks to call it quits in 1981. The band regrouped in the 1990s, and continued to put out music until 2014. However, Buzzcocks&#x27;s musical legacy was cemented by those furious love songs penned as traditional punk was coming apart. Shelley&#x27;s death was announced Thursday on the band&#x27;s Twitter page. &quot;It&#x27;s with great sadness that we confirm the death of Pete Shelley, one of the UK&#x27;s most influential and prolific songwriters,&quot; the message stated. The tributes to Shelley began pouring in immediately from both his original punks and younger musicians who were inspired by the band&#x27;s classic years. &quot;I am totally shocked and saddened to just hear of the untimely death of Pete Shelley,&quot; original Sex Pistols bass guitarist Glen Matlock wrote on Twitter. &quot;A superb songwriter, artist and a totally sweet hearted guy who was one of the very few originals of punk and even a one off within that.&quot;",

Address: 725 Burnet Ave., Syracuse. <i>Jacob Pucci | jpucci@syracuse.com</i> <b>Angotti&#x27;s </b> There&#x27;s a colorful trend in most of the food in Angotti&#x27;s, in case you couldn&#x27;t tell by the picture above. The red sauce is a family recipe owners Bobby Angotti and his parents Anthony and Susie developed when they took over the restaurant in 1986 from Carmine Angotti, Bobby&#x27;s grandfather, who opened the restaurant in 1961, five years after he moved from Taverna, Italy to Syracuse. Related:  Keeping it classic: 4 Syracuse Italian restaurants that have stood the test of time The sauce coats the bottoms of platters of chicken Parmesan, lasagna and eggplant Parmesan like a silky-smooth bedsheet. It tops the side bowls of al dente spaghetti. When our waitress asked if we&#x27;d like a side of sauce for our hilariously-large cheese and sausage calzone, we said yes, not knowing that it was akin to bringing a kiddie pool to the ocean. Clockwise from bottom left: Eggplant Parmesan ($14.95), linguini with white clam sauce ($11.95), lasagna ($8.95), chicken Parmesan ($14.95), cup of extra sauce, side of spaghetti and a sausage and cheese calzone ($7.25). <i>Charlie Miller | cmiller@syracuse.com</i> <b>Angotti&#x27;s </b> The antipasto salad at Angotti&#x27;s comes in three sizes and range in price from $5.75 to $9.95. The medium pictured above ($7.95) was billed as serving two, but it was plenty for the three of us. The bed of iceburg lettuce was topped with sliced ham, salami, provolone cheese, black olives, grape tomatoes and cucumbers. The tuna is optional, but recommended. The bread at Angotti&#x27;s is from Geddes Bakery in North Syracuse, which, having opened in 1957, has been around CNY even longer than Angotti&#x27;s.",

      "full": "Not only is the Nintendo Switch selling like hotcakes, the hybrid console system also scored the two best-reviewed games of 2017: &quot;The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild&quot; and &quot;Super Mario Odyssey.&quot; The 19th installment in Nintendo&#x27;s &quot;Zelda&quot; franchise masterfully married its open-world NES roots with an unparalleled sense of exploration and a haunting story. But &quot;Super Mario Odyssey&quot; deftly recaptured the open-world magic of &quot;Super Mario 64,&quot; adding in some innovative platform mechanics. Which game deserves top honors? The Nintendo Switch is currently outselling both the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, buoyed by not just one potential Game of the Year title, but two. Not only is it a major coup for the 128-year-old video game company, it&#x27;s incredibly rare. In an industry where it takes hundreds of professionals and years to make a single game, pumping out two nearly perfect video games in less than eight months is something of a miracle. But here we are. Which Switch game deserves top honors? For many, &quot;Breath of the Wild&quot; is a slam-dunk for video game of the year. Nintendo returned to the series&#x27; open-world roots but dialed up the sense of adventure and exploration--packaged in a wonderful and haunting story. Granting Zelda fans unparalleled freedom, allowing gamers to discover and open up worlds at their leisure, and allowing for players to beat the game any number of ways resulted in a very personal, intimate gaming experience. Some intrepid gamers beat &quot;Breath of the Wild&quot; in under one hour, others have spent over 60 hours in the virtual world of Hyrule. It combined the best part of modern game mechanics and the most nostalgic elements of the franchise. &quot;Breath of the Wild&quot; was pure bliss, and for many, that makes it an easy contender for Game of the Year. The only video game developer that could take away the Game of the Year honors from Nintendo ... is Nintendo. &quot;Super Mario Odyssey&quot; is a distillation of childhood joy and adventure in a cartridge form, with Nintendo putting on a clinic on how to develop a video game that manages to entertain children and old farts alike. After Mario&#x27;s more linear adventures, Nintendo returned to the free-form style of &quot;Super Mario 64,&quot; empowering gamers to clear levels any number of ways. (Like reaching an unexplored area via a complex combination of jump moves or simply finding an invisible passageway.) But even more impressive is the combination of old-school mechanics, like the triple-jump, with some novel additions like Cappy--a bizarre ghost-hat-thing that Mario uses to possess objects and enemies. You have not lived until you have possessed a dozen Goombas standing on each other&#x27;s shoulders. Simply put, &quot;Super Mario Odyssey&quot; is a wonderful and joy-filled adventure that both inspires and challenges. It&#x27;s the easy contender for Game of the Year.

Briggs Leone is now waiting for the last few permits, and the waiting has been the hard part. During the last year and half of working on the lounge, the paperwork and applications felt never-ending. Briggs Leone also ran into issues regarding zoning laws, which were later straightened out with City Hall.",

Many fans still argue &quot;The Cosby Show&quot; is a classic family sitcom which paved the way for other black family sitcoms, regardless of Cosby.

      "full": "Before James Franklin won a Big Ten Championship Game, he analyzed one. The Penn State coach celebrated an unlikely Big Ten title Saturday night only one year after he was part of the FOX Sports broadcast team for the game. Franklin acknowledged that the experience as an analyst -- he also worked the national championship game while at Vanderbilt -- helped him prepare as a coach. &quot;I took a bunch of notes that whole weekend while it was going on, before it started, after the game was over when I came back,&quot; Franklin said. &quot;Actually being there on the sidelines helped me kind of understand what the environment was going to be like, what the venue was like, the atmosphere.&quot; So who would be the right guy for the guest appearance when it comes to coverage of the College Football Playoff? How about Rutgers coach Chris Ash? Here are five reasons that you can expect to hear from Ash often -- Rutgers fans should rejoice at this prospect -- over the next month on the national picture, whether it&#x27;s as part of a broadcast team or making the rounds on sports talk shows. 1. He faced at least 2 of the participants. Any way you slice it, Rutgers faced two of the four participants. If it&#x27;s Alabama, Ohio State, Clemson and Washington, Ash, Auburn&#x27;s Gus Malzahn (Alabama, Clemson) and USC&#x27;s Clay Helton (Alabama, Washington) will be the only three coaches in the country to face two of the semifinalists -- and Malzahn and Helton might have their own New Year&#x27;s Six bowls to coach. If Michigan or Penn States sneaks into the CFP at the expense of Ohio State or Washington, nothing changes on Ash&#x27;s resume. In case you think he&#x27;s not willing, Ash compared Washington, Ohio State and Michigan for USA TODAY last month. 2. He knows what it takes to beat Alabama. It all just kind of feels like playing for second place to Alabama, right? Well, it felt a little (not as much) like that two seasons ago, too, when Alabama was No. 1, Oregon was No. 2, Florida State was No. 3 and Ohio State was No. 4. Then a funny thing happened ... Ohio State upset Alabama in the semifinals. Ash was defensive coordinator at Ohio State then. The Buckeyes forced three second-half interceptions in rallying from a 21-6 deficit to a 42-28 lead. Alabama hasn&#x27;t lost since then, winning 25 straight as it pursues back-to-back national titles. 3. He is brutally honest. How many times have you seen that description of Ash on NJ.com in the last year? That&#x27;s because it&#x27;s refreshing in today&#x27;s world to see a coach who doesn&#x27;t flat-out lie, hide behind cliches or dance around big-picture questions. Michigan&#x27;s Jim Harbaugh practically is a ballerina -- except for when it serves him best. Where would Ash&#x27;s willingness to criticize play well to an audience? In an analyst&#x27;s chair. Plus, he has experience in front of the camera on the weekly Chris Ash Show streamed online and the &quot;RFootball with Chris Ash&quot; show hosted by Bruce Beck and aired on MSG Plus. 4. It would be good for recruiting. As Ash&#x27;s mentor, Ohio State&#x27;s Urban Meyer, recently pointed out when asked about having a social media presence, every decision a program makes now is with an eye toward recruiting. What&#x27;s better for recruiting than having the head coach on national television breaking down the biggest games of the season with tons of high school stars tuning in? Since they all have smart phones glued to their hands, maybe some will Google Ash&#x27;s name and see his resume -- and the chance for immediate playing time at Rutgers. 5. He is a copious note-taker. Unlike Franklin at this time last season, Ash already has a frame of reference. Ash prepared for three Big Ten title games as a coordinator -- two with Wisconsin -- and a national championship with Ohio State. &quot;All these things are opportunities to learn and grow,&quot; Franklin said, &quot;so that when the time comes, you have some background, some experiences, some feel for what it will be like.&quot; Copious note-taking is one of Ash&#x27;s fortes. He has dozens of binders to prove it. &quot;I&#x27;ve got some fairly thorough notes that I&#x27;ve taken throughout the year,&quot; Ash said. &quot;Good notes, bad notes. Things that we need to adjust on in Year Two. Things that we liked in Year One.",

At 6-foot-1, 205 pounds, the former Paramus Catholic High School two-way star is too small to play linebacker in the NFL. Kiper compared Peppers to Su&#x27;a Cravens, who was a second-round pick of the Washington Redskins out of USC in the 2016 draft. &quot;There is a role in certain defenses with Peppers,&quot; Kiper said, &quot;that won&#x27;t be (there) with others. Some players everybody is either going to like or not, but this is a case where some will, some won&#x27;t. He&#x27;s not going to fit what everybody does, and they won&#x27;t be able to creatively find a way to maximize all that talent.&quot; Peppers is a finalist for the Heisman Trophy to be announced Saturday and the Bednarik Award as the nation&#x27;s top defensive player to be announced Thursday night. He was named the 2016 Big Ten Defensive and Special Teams Player of the Year, winning the Hornung Award as the nation&#x27;s most versatile player.

(Michael Reaves | Getty Images) NEW YORK -- Jabrill Peppers didn&#x27;t win the Heisman Trophy, but apparently he would make a good voter. Like the former Paramus Catholic High School star predicted, it was a two-horse race and he was on the outside, finishing a distant fifth after garnering 11 first-place votes from the 929 electors. The winner was 19-year-old Louisville quarterback Lamar Jackson -- who was the story of September in college football. As the school&#x27;s first Heisman winner and the youngest winner ever, he totaled 2,144 total points, including 526 first-place votes. Clemson&#x27;s Deshaun Watson, who finished third in 2015, was a finalist for the second straight year. Michigan&#x27;s Peppers was listed as a 50-to-1 underdog and embraced the realistic role, saying he would&#x27;ve voted for Watson and Jackson as his top two. Oklahoma&#x27;s quarterback-wide receiver duo of Baker Mayfield and Dede Westbrook rounded out the quintet of fun-loving finalists at Marriott Marquis in Times Square. &quot;I&#x27;m not nervous,&quot; Peppers said Saturday night before the winner was announced. &quot;I&#x27;m just excited. I&#x27;m just happy I&#x27;m here. Meeting these guys and forming the relationships and having a good time in New York, there&#x27;s nothing better.&quot; Watson finished with 269 first-place votes and 1,524 points, taking second. Mayfield (26 and 361), Westbrook (seven and 209) and Peppers (11 and 208) were the next three in line, with Peppers getting 50 points in the Mid-Atlantic Region (New Jersey), 39 in the Midwest region, 37 in the Far West and 33 in the Northeast. Peppers was named the Big Ten&#x27;s Linebacker of the Year, Special Teams Player of the Year and Defensive Player of the Year. He became the first player to win three individual honors since the amount of hardware handed out increased in 2011.",

Watson got the nod over Lamar Jackson for me because he led Clemson to a win over Jackson&#x27;s Louisville team in a battle for ACC supremacy in early October.

The reason why he slipped to third for me is his late-season struggles (46.5 completion percentage in loss vs. Houston, 3 INTs in loss vs. Kentucky) and the fact that Louisville missed out on a major bowl game. <i>Photo by Tyler Smith | Getty Images</i> <b>Ryan Dunleavy&#x27;s 1st place vote</b> Deshaun Watson, Clemson: Everyone waiting for a &quot;Heisman moment&quot; in November probably missed it in October when Deshaun Watson threw two touchdown passes and a two-point conversion in the final seven minutes to spark a comeback win against Louisville....then struck again in the final three minutes of the fourth quarter to beat Florida State.

      "full": "There are certain perks that come along with having your state&#x27;s top player committed to your program, none bigger than the recruiting boost it naturally propels. But in Micah Clark&#x27;s case, he has taken things even further to ensure there will be talent around him once he officially arrives on the banks. The 6-5, 270-pound four-star from St. John Vianney (Holmdel, N.J.) chose Rutgers over offers from Alabama, Michigan, Clemson, Miami, Ohio State, Penn State and a slew of other household names. And he&#x27;s remained 100% committed despite a disappointing 2-10 season on the gridiron. Clark took his Rutgers official visit last weekend but found himself back on campus this past weekend in an effort to recruit players potentially on the cusp of joining the fold. &quot;I just went up and talked to Johnathan Lovett and the recruits that were thinking about coming here,&quot; Clark told NJ.com Sunday. But it was Lovett who Clark targeted hardest, despite the running back decommitting from the program in November. &quot;I think I really got to Lovett because this girl from his school asked him, oh, you decommitted from here and now you&#x27;re here again. Are you thinking about coming here. He looks at me and he goes,&#x27; Yeah, I think I am going to come back.&#x27; We&#x27;re still high on his list. So that&#x27;s really good. I feel comfortable that I did my job to keep him here.&quot; Clark also claims a small role in the recruitment of Ihmir Marsette, Rutgers&#x27; latest addition. &quot;All the other recruits worked on Ihmir the most. But I dapped him up (shook hands with him) and said what&#x27;s up so he didn&#x27;t feel I was overlooking him. I also told him welcome to the family, we would love to have you and it looks like that worked. It was just a simple thing,&quot; he said. Clark also put in work last weekend while on his official visit. He was hosted by offensive Kamaal Seymour, but also spent time with Kevin Wilkins, Dorian Miller and others. &quot;The best part was really spending time with the guys when I was at the bowling alley and how we all bonded,&quot; he said. &quot;We were just having fun.&quot; In addition to said fun and recruiting, Clark also bonded with fellow incoming offensive lineman Sam Vretman, a three-star from Cheshire Academy in Connecticut. &quot;The recruit I bonded with the most is Sam Vretman. Me and Sam were probably with each other the majority of the visit. We went everywhere (together),&quot; said Clark. &quot;We were working on Brendan Bordner, a defensive end from Ohio. And me and Sam really got to know each other better. &quot;He told me how he&#x27;s from Sweden and how much of a change it is being over here. Then we went out and we found a Swedish girl and he told me how it was such a relief to like talk Swedish with other people and not just his parents. I just really got to know Sam and he&#x27;s a great kid.&quot; Rutgers head coach Chris Ash is appreciative of the recruiting effort his biggest coup has put into helping build his roster. &quot;I saw coach (Ash) this weekend (Saturday),&quot; said Clark. &quot;He just asked me how I was doing. I told him I&#x27;m doing great. And he was like we are doing great things here and he&#x27;s glad that I am helping out with the recruits and all. And like, just telling me how that shows character and leadership of my class.&quot; Despite a strong week of Rutgers recruiting, Micah and his fellow commits were disappointed to find out former offensive coordinator Drew Mehringer would be leaving the program to take a passing game coordinator role at the University of Texas. However, his departure hasn&#x27;t affected Clark&#x27;s intentions. &quot;Coach (Blazek) told me earlier today (Sunday),&quot; he said. &quot;They told all the guys. All the guys know, so like nothing&#x27;s hidden from the team. And like we didn&#x27;t find out on Twitter or in the press. He told us straight up and he told us why. And we understood it. Everyone in the group chat understood. Everyone is still committed to Rutgers because nothing is going to change. Our offense is not going to change. &quot;It doesn&#x27;t change anything for me,&quot; Clark continued. &quot;Like, Drew, he&#x27;s a cool guy. I just wish him the best. He&#x27;s coaching for a college that he really wants to coach for. His mentor is there and he&#x27;s just doing what&#x27;s best for him and his career path.&quot; Clark is so confident in Rutgers that he could arrive on campus even earlier than first expected. &quot;I can&#x27;t wait to get up in January,&quot; he said. &quot;I might be coming earlier like the 13th or something because my school said it&#x27;s not the 15th or the 17th. That&#x27;s like the weekend. Me and my brother are taking our finals before everybody else.&quot; When Clark does finally enroll on the banks, he and fellow top commits like Bo Melton will be counted on to lead. But in the meantime, Clark has bonded more with the linemen, while Melton has played more of a role with skill position recruits. &quot;He&#x27;s kind of like quiet around me,&quot; said Clark of Melton. &quot;I guess it&#x27;s a skill position thing. Him, Bryce and Lovett, they all clique. But Bo is my man.&quot; Rebuilding Rutgers: From The Ashes takes you inside the new football regime.

(Bo Rader | Wichita Eagle/TNS) The first time that Rutgers coach Chris Ash had to a hire an offensive coordinator he tapped a highly regarded 28-year-old first-time play-caller. It worked in recruiting. It did not work on the field. So could Ash go in a completely different direction this time around? NJ Advance Media learned Wednesday that Ash spoke with former Minnesota head coach Kill about the position, though it is unclear if Kill interviewed or is on board as a consultant. UPDATE: Kill interviewed with Ash at Rutgers on Thursday, according to a Tweet from Joe Schmit of KSTP-TV in Minnesota. Neither Kill, who is an associate athletics director at Kansas State, nor Ash replied to messages seeking comment. Here are five things to know about Kill: 1. He last served as an offensive coordinator in 1993. Kill took the old-fashioned route to Big Ten head coach, climbing his way from offensive coordinator at Pittsburg State (Kansas) to head coach at Saginaw Valley State to Emporia State to Southern Illinois to Northern Illinois to Minnesota. It&#x27;s reminiscent of Brian Kelly&#x27;s path to Notre Dame. At the end of Kill&#x27;s tenure, Minnesota had two play-callers -- Matt Limegrover for running plays and Jim Zebrowski for passing plays. When Tracy Claeys -- Kill&#x27;s defensive coordinator -- succeeded him, he let go of both Limegrover and Zebrowski. Interestingly, Kill played linebacker and started his coaching career as a defensive coordinator. 2. He suffers from epileptic seizures.<br/> For the last 12 years -- since he was 43 -- Kill has suffered from epilepsy, which is what forced him into a reluctant retirement in October 2015. A cancer survivor, Kill suffered a seizure on the Minnesota sidelines during a home game in 2011. At the time of his retirement, Kill choked back tears as he cited the toll his condition took on his mind, body and family as the reason for his retirement. Kill missed at least a portion of five games during his first three seasons at Minnesota, according to the Associated Press.",

The 40-year-old search firm is one of the oldest in the field. Bob Beaudine, the company&#x27;s CEO, took over the business from his father and made sports and entertainment the firm&#x27;s specialty. In addition to finding athletic directors and head coaches for top universities, Beaudine runs searches for executives in sports franchises and entertainment companies. Barchi fired Hermann and Flood Sunday after the football team went 4-8 in a season marred by scandals off the field, including the arrests of several players. Barchi said Rutgers athletics needed a &quot;change in leadership.&quot; The university will not have to hire a search firm to mount a national search for a new athletic director to replace Hermann. Barchi immediately appointed Patrick Hobbs, the dean emeritus of Seton Hall University School of Law, as the new athletic director after dismissing Hermann. Hobbs&#x27; first job is leading the search for a new football coach with the help of Eastman & Beaudine. &quot;We all believe that Rutgers football can be competitive in the Big Ten Conference and we will find the right coach who can get us to that place,&quot; Barchi said in his letter to the university community Sunday. &quot;In the coming days and weeks, you may read and hear rumors, speculation, opinions and concerns, regarding the football search.

He&#x27;s got a great background with the university. He was a recruiting coordinator in the Big Ten. I think Pat brings a lot to the table. He&#x27;s got a wealth of experience. He&#x27;s just one of those guys you want to run through a wall for.&quot; Flaherty, 59, coached the offensive line at Rutgers from 1984-91. He interviewed at Rutgers in 2012 before then-athletic director Tim Pernetti hired Kyle Flood, who was fired on Nov. 29 after four seasons. &quot;Flats would be an excellent coach for RU,&quot; former Rutgers and Giants offensive lineman Shaun O&#x27;Hara. &quot;He is a great coach and has proven it at every level. I think having two Super Bowl rings would be quite the endorsement for him and his pedigree, plus I know he is very well respected in the state by a number of high school coaches. He knows Rutgers.&quot; Flaherty does not have head coaching experience, but he would bring a familiarity with Rutgers and the Big Ten. Flaherty also coached at Penn State in 1982-83, winning a national title in 1982, and at Iowa, where he served in several roles in 1999, including as the Hawkeyes&#x27; recruiting coordinator. Flaherty&#x27;s coaching resume includes stops at East Carolina and Wake Forest. Flaherty has been the Giants&#x27; offensive line coach for 12 seasons, and has coached for the Chicago Bears and Washington Redskins. Flaherty, who is married with two college-aged children, is a Hanover, Pa., native. He was an All-American lineman at East Stroudsburg University. &quot;I know the high school coaches would support him,&quot; said Montgomery High coach Zoran Milich, who played under Flaherty at Rutgers and is the vice president of the state coaches association. &quot;I would love for coach Flaherty to get the job.&quot; Jordan Raanan can be reached at jraanan@njadvancemedia.com and James Kratch can be reached at jkratch@njadvancemedia.com or by leaving a note in the comments below.

      "full": "Rutgers fans can take a glimpse into their past -- and possibly future -- on Saturday when Temple faces Houston in the American Athletic Conference championship game (12 p.m., ABC). As far as the past, Rutgers was a member of the AAC for one season, going 6-7 in 2013 before jumping to the Big Ten. As for the future, Rutgers fans will want to keep an eye on Temple coach Matt Rhule. Rhule&#x27;s name hasn&#x27;t been linked much to the coaching vacancy at Rutgers this week, but that could change after the Owls end their regular season. The 40-year-old has become a hot name after leading Temple to a 10-2 season. But with Rutgers, Syracuse and South Carolina standing as the only power conference openings remaining, Rhule will have to enter the mix quickly or stick at Temple for at least another year. Houston is led by Tom Herman, another coach who figured to draw serious interest on the open market. So the school locked him up with a contract extension that boosted his salary from $1.35 million to $2.8 million. Herman had been on Rutgers&#x27; radar in the past when former coach Kyle Flood was on the hot seat. But Flood managed to keep his job for four seasons until he was fired on Sunday. Meanwhile, Herman left his post as Ohio State&#x27;s offensive coordinator after last season and has led Houston to an 11-1. There will be plenty of intrigue on the sidelines when the teams meet on Saturday and plenty at stake: The winner is a near lock to earn a New Year&#x27;s Six bowl bid as the top Group of 5 team.

The college football coaching carousel continues to spin, leaving just Rutgers, Syracuse and South Carolina as power conference programs without a head coach. Virginia removed itself from that list by going outside the box and hiring BYU coach Bronco Mendenhall on Friday. South Carolina has had an opening since Steve Spurrier stepped down on Oct. 12, but that search is only now heating up. South Carolina reportedly plans to interview former Florida coach Will Muschamp, Arizona coach Rich Rodriguez, South Florida coach Willie Taggart, Oklahoma offensive coordinator Lincoln Riley and former Rutgers coach Greg Schiano. Schiano has reportedly interviewed for openings at USC, Central Florida and Miami, and he was linked to the Virginia vacancy before Mendenhall&#x27;s hiring was announced. There was a report earlier this week from USA Today that Syracuse is zeroing in on Bowling Green coach Dino Babers for its opening. That report hasn&#x27;t been confirmed elsewhere, but that could change after Bowling Green won the MAC Championship on Friday night. As for Rutgers, Friday was another quiet day on its coaching search, at least publicly.

I look forward to completing this process and sharing the news with all of you.&quot; Hobbs was scheduled to attend the Rutgers women&#x27;s soccer team&#x27;s national semifinal game against Penn State in Cary, N.C., on Friday afternoon, but it&#x27;s unclear if he made the trip.

The 41-year-old first-time head coach has a lot on his plate and will need to get to work immediately to turn the program around. Here are the top 10 priorities for Ash: <i>Todderick Hunt | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com</i> <b>Recruit, recruit, recruit</b> With national signing day less than two months away, Ash needs to hit the recruiting trail running. His first priority should be reaffirming Rutgers&#x27; current commitments, beginning with quarterback Anthony Russo (pictured). It would be a huge boost if Ash can flip a top recruit or land an uncommitted prospect, like Jordan Fuller, a four-star defensive back from Old Tappan. <i>Tony Ding | AP Photo</i> <b>Establish an offensive identity</b> Ash has spent his entire coaching career on defense, so he&#x27;s a blank slate on the other side of the ball. He apprenticed under Bret Bielema&#x27;s pro-style and Urban Meyer&#x27;s power spread, so it&#x27;s unclear what scheme he&#x27;ll employ. Hiring a top-rate offensive coordinator will be crucial for Ash. <i>Amanda Marzullo | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com</i> <b>Get to know the N.J. high school coaches</b> There is universal agreement that the key to getting Rutgers to the next level is keeping the top New Jersey prospects home. That starts with building relationships with the high school coaches, like Don Bosco&#x27;s Greg Toal (pictured). Ash may not have strong ties to the Jersey coaches, so he must address that immediately. Ash should hold a summit for all of the Jersey high school coaches like Greg Schiano did when he was hired 15 years ago to emphasize the importance of building a pipeline to Rutgers. <i>John Munson | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com</i> <b>Hire some assistants with Jersey ties</b> Ash isn&#x27;t going to be able to build strong relationships with New Jersey high school coaches overnight, so he&#x27;ll need to find some assistants with existing ties in the state. That could mean retaining recruiting coordinator E.J. Barthel (pictured), wide receivers coach Anthony Campanile or another staff member. If Ash decides to bring in an entirely new staff, he must find some assistants with experience recruiting Jersey. <i>Patti Sapone | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com</i> <b>Set a disciplinary tone with returning players</b> Ash needs to set a standard of accountability from Day 1. He needs to change a culture that got lax late in former coach Kyle Flood&#x27;s tenure. If there are any holdovers who aren&#x27;t on board with the new direction, they will need to be removed from the program. It&#x27;s not pretty, but it&#x27;s a reality of any coaching change that there will be some house cleaning. <i>AP Photo</i> <b>Sell himself and the program at every opportunity</b> Ash is going to be busy working within the program, but he must take advantage of every opportunity to sell himself and his vision for Rutgers to the public. Ash isn&#x27;t a household name with recruits or casual fans, so he needs to make himself visible. Bringing his national championship ring along will help his push for credibility.",

As he was giving Ash the tour of the Rutgers facilities, he was seeing them the first time himself. So now that he finally can get settled into the job, let’s look at the most important priorities for Pat Hobbs as he tries to stabilize an athletic department that has suffered through some rough days. <i>Saed Hindash | NJ Advance Media</i> <b>Set a vision</b> This might be his most vital task. What does Rutgers want to be? What does Rutgers stand for? What is the goal that all Rutgers coaches are striving to achieve? It is up to the athletic director to set that vision, and Rutgers has lacked that for a while. <i>AP file photo</i> <b>Raise money</b> Hobbs had a reputation as a good fundraiser, and there is no doubt that his skill in that area will be tested.

Rutgers was actually heading in the right direction under Julie Hermann in fundraising, and Hobbs can make his biggest impact here. <i>AP Photo | Mel Evans</i> <b>Address basketball</b> Hobbs was so busy finalizing the details with Chris Ash that he didn’t get to watch much of the basketball team’s loss to Seton Hall, and that’s probably a good thing. Still: How much time does Eddie Jordan have left if the team is noncompetitive again? <i>Rutgers University photo</i> <b>Facilities</b> Rutgers has a solid plan for its facilities now. Hobbs should try to drive that over the finish line, starting with the basketball practice facility that everyone agrees is necessary for that program to have a fighting chance. <i>John Munson | NJ Advance Media</i> <b>Support Chris Ash</b> The new coach doesn’t know what he needs yet, but he’s going to figure that out out in a hurry. Is it changes to the locker room? More money for a top offensive coordinator? Hobbs’ answer needs to be “I’ll get it done.” <i>Andrew Mills | NJ Advance Media</i> <b>Oversight</b> A strong athletic director makes sure that Kyle Flood never tramples on university policy and contacts a professor about a player’s grade. Putting out fires before they turn into infernos is truly a crucial role for an AD now that college programs are essentially businesses. <i>George McNish | For NJ Advance Media</i> <b>Community outreach</b> It was always stunning how Hermann spent most of her time during basketball games isolated in her “bunker” at the Rutgers Athletic Center. Hobbs spent much of his first public appearance at the RAC shaking hands, and that will go a long way toward mending fences. <i>John Munson | NJ Advance Media</i>",

      "full": "For two seasons at Florida, Jonathan Mitchell was the product of a team with a killer instinct. The whole reason he saw playing time as a freshman on a national championship team was because the 2006-07 Gators were merciless basketball killing machines. &quot;Those dudes were relentless,&quot; Mitchell recalled in a quiet moment last night. &quot;They wanted to blow teams out by 50 every game.&quot; So after his Rutgers team put the finishing touches on its seventh win of the year — a 79-65 decision over in-state rival Fairleigh Dickinson — Mitchell and the rest of his teammates felt the wrath of their head coach, Mike Rice. The reason? For all of the success this team has had, it hasn&#x27;t found out how to beat opponents into the ground. &quot;We lack an edge, yes,&quot; Rice said. &quot;We lack an edge. When we get up — and there were stretches for 4-5 minutes were we&#x27;re OK — but then we literally turn it off. The intensity, the energy, everything just goes out of us. And that can&#x27;t happen. That&#x27;s something that we have to remedy.&quot; The problem that Rice and his Scarlet Knights are facing is that there are just three non-conference games in which to do it. Rice alluded to his team&#x27;s non-conference schedule as a buildup to the final exam of the brutally tough Big East slate, which begins for Rutgers on Jan. 2 at No. 10 Villanova. Yet last night against a gritty, but overmatched FDU (3-6) team, Rutgers once again slipped while trying to put the foot on the throat of its opponent. The Scarlet Knights (7-2) were up 40-25 at the half, but were outscored 40-39 in the second half. Mitchell led the way with 22 points, but the defense surrendered 23 to FDU&#x27;s Mike Scott. &quot;(Rice) always says its so easy to do the easy thing, take the easy route,&quot; sophomore Austin Johnson said. &quot;That&#x27;s what comes to us, it&#x27;s clear. We just have to become comfortable in being in chaos. We have to become comfortable in taking the tougher route and doing the things that we don&#x27;t want to do, because that&#x27;s what wins games.&quot; What Rice is trying to avoid is another letdown once the conference schedule begins. The last two seasons under coach Fred Hill, Rutgers was 9-4 and 9-3 respectively before beginning Big East play. But once it entered the league jungle... &quot;That wasn&#x27;t fun,&quot; Johnson said. &quot;I don&#x27;t think (the freshmen) understand what we&#x27;re in for. The Big East is no joke. I don&#x27;t ever want to experience that again. I want to keep this rolling, I want to keep this going.&quot; In order to do that, Rutgers knows that it needs to find the gumption to bury teams that it is superior to. Mitchell felt that part of the reason why there has been a disconnect is because of the early success that this team has had. &quot;We&#x27;re still adjusting to being up on teams, &quot; he said. &quot;The next step is learning how to put a team away.&quot;",

Nova completed 11-of-26 passes for 108 yards, no touchdowns and two interceptions in a 45-3 loss at Michigan State on Nov. 22. Nova arrived at that game with his right foot in a walking boot, and he took the field with his right knee in a brace and both ankles heavily taped.

But you just have to deal with it.&quot; Nova didn&#x27;t magically heal in the seven days between the Michigan State and Maryland games. The walking boot has become a staple of his daily wardrobe and his lower body continues to be mummified in a brace and tape on game day.

But suddenly he found his groove and began slinging picture-perfect passes all over the field to lead Rutgers to a 41-38 comeback win. There was a beautiful deep ball to Janarion Grant on the pivotal drive at the end of the first half that started the comeback. Nova finished that drive with a perfectly-placed touchdown pass to Andre Patton while rolling to his left. It continued in the second half with a 42-yard connection to Leonte Carroo after evading a free blitzer off the edge. Then there was an NFL-caliber strike to Carroo into a tiny window for 23 yards to set up the game-winning field goal.",

After Seton Hall contacted Rutgers to come up with an idea to make the annual game special again, Kevin Lorincz, the basketball sports information director at Rutgers, was assigned the job of figuring out a trophy. Lorincz had driven to Asbury Park after Sandy in a Rutgers van to pick up the old boardwalk planks, in hopes they could be put to use. But how? A simple Google search gave him his answer: Colin Pezzano, a 2014 graduate of the University of the Arts from Sewell, who was voted the No. 1 collegiate woodworking artist in the country. Lorincz called him and proposed the idea. &quot;I can do this!&quot; Pezzano replied. It took about two weeks, with each piece separately cut and crafted, to create.

(John Munson | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com) Rutgers has long known the harsh reality of the college football bowl system, that having a deserving resume has about as much to do with the placement of a team as the color of its uniforms. This was driven home early, in 2006, when Rutgers was one dropped pass away from the BCS title … and dropped all the way to the inaugural Texas Bowl, against a lousy Kansas State team, and had to fight just to get the game on cable systems back home. But all that was supposed to change in the Big Ten, the land of the fat TV contracts and institutional influence. The idea that there is even the potential that a 7-5 Rutgers team get left out of a bowl is absurd, but one Rutgers insider described the level of panic in Piscataway as a 9 on a 1-10 scale. It&#x27;s real, as our Keith Sargeant explains, and it would be devastating – both to a football team that needs the exposure for recruiting and extra practices for its young players, and for the image of the athletic department as a whole. So now we&#x27;ll see just how much juice Julie Hermann has in college sports, because it&#x27;s the job of an athletic director to use his or her relationships and influence to find the best possible spot for the team. That&#x27;s on Hermann, and it&#x27;s clear from a memo from associate Big Ten commissioner Mark Rudner that the conference isn&#x27;t going to twist arms for the new guy. So it&#x27;s up to Rutgers to make the case that its a better option than the competition, and while the situation can change quickly, the early buzz is not promising. Can a 6-6 Illinois team, a program that doesn&#x27;t travel well historically, really take the Big Ten&#x27;s slot in the Quick Lane Bowl in Detroit just because its camps is a four-hour drive away? Can a 7-5 Maryland team, one that the Scarlet Knights stunned in their regular-season finale, have a better shot at the Heart of Dallas Bowl with the same obstacles – an early December 26 kickoff and difficult holiday travel – as Rutgers? &quot;We look forward to making our case,&quot; Hermann said after the Maryland win. &quot;We&#x27;ll be working the phones tomorrow, talking to a lot of the bowl reps. The Big Ten has created an amazing slate for all of the (teams).

Robinson will be on headset, communicating to the in-game stadium producer and alerting DJ Yoshi on when to play. &quot;The last three seasons I get more calls from people asking how do you do it than you can believe,&#x27;&#x27; Robinson said. &quot;I tell everyone that you can&#x27;t just hire any DJ you&#x27;d find in a club. DJ Yoshi has 10 years of stadium-venue experience so he knows when to play and when not to play, he knows all the little things to do that will change the experience; The thing I like about Yoshi the most is he plays to the crowd. He can play crossover stuff, mixing both old and new music to appeal to a wide range of people within the crowd.&#x27;&#x27; The sight of a DJ spinning music for football games these days is hardly unusual, but it&#x27;s believed that Rutgers was the first major college football program to put a DJ on the field to enhance the stadium atmosphere. Robinson recalls sitting down with Greg Schiano seven years ago when the former Rutgers coach asked for ideas to improve the in-game experience.",

      "full": "Steve Longa Rutgers linebacker Steve Longa leads the team with 93 tackles this season. (John Munson | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com) PISCATAWAY — Rutgers redshirt sophomore Steve Longa has experienced some significant changes in the past year. After leading the Scarlet Knights in tackles last season at middle linebacker, Longa switched to weak side linebacker in the spring. At the same time, Longa changed his major from mechanical engineering to economics. &quot;It&#x27;s going pretty well,&quot; Longa said. &quot;I like knowing how money flows into our economy. It&#x27;s something that interests me.&quot; Longa initially majored in mechanical engineering because working with cars and building motors is his passion. But the time demands of the major were extensive, and he decided to make the change. Although he changed his major, Longa plans to continue spending his free time working on his 2004 Chrysler Crossfire, a sports car that hasn&#x27;t been produced since 2007. &quot;I&#x27;m still going to do it as a hobby,&quot; Longa said. &quot;I work on my car all the time. I actually already bought parts that I&#x27;m going to be working on during the winter. It&#x27;s something I like doing. I&#x27;m not going to stop working on cars, but I had to just switch (the major).&quot; Longa&#x27;s future plans will tie his previous major and his current major together. Longa&#x27;s father, Etienne, owns a truck company. &quot;I want to own my own business and take my dad&#x27;s business to the next level,&quot; Longa said. &quot;It&#x27;s a little business that he has, but he can&#x27;t compete with those big-time ones because they&#x27;re already established everywhere.&quot; As for the other change, Longa didn&#x27;t match his 123 tackles from last season. But he said he was comfortable in the new position and he still led the team with 93 tackles. &quot;I think the reason he has the numbers he has in tackles is because he can close on the ball,&quot; Rutgers coach Kyle Flood said. &quot;There&#x27;s certainly some of those tackles at the point of attack, but guys who can run like that have a tendency to make a lot of plays from behind as well and run some plays down. I think that&#x27;s a good part of his numbers.&quot; Dan Duggan may be reached at dduggan@njadvancemedia.com. Follow him on Twitter @DDuggan21. Find NJ.com Rutgers Football on Facebook.

      "full": "Big Ten Championship Football Members of the Ohio State Buckeyes celebrate after defeating the Wisconsin Badgers 59-0 in the Big Ten Conference championship NCAA college football game Saturday, Dec. 6 2014, in Indianapolis. (AP Photo/Michael Conroy) (Michael Conroy) About the First Four Poll: Each week during the college football season, our committee of 13 national experts will rank the teams competing for a spot in the inaugural College Football Playoff. These rankings will provide a look at how the contenders for the four playoff berths stack up and offer an alternative perspective to the official College Football Playoff rankings. About the voters: We&#x27;ve assembled a baker&#x27;s dozen of top college sports writers from coast to coast. They are: Nick Baumgardner, MLive.com; Ken Goe, The Oregonian; David Jones, PennLive.com; Jim Kleinpeter, NOLA.com/The Times-Picayune; Gary Laney, Advance Digital National Desk; Tom Layberger, Advance Digital National Desk; Doug Lesmerises, Northeast Ohio Media Group; Nick O&#x27;Malley, MassLive.com; Kevin Scarbinsky, Alabama Media Group; Keith Sargeant, NJ.com; Patrick Stevens, Syracuse.com; Jim Waggoner, Staten Island Advance; Brad Wilson, lehighvalleylive.com/The Express-Times. ====== If you were looking for close, the vote in the final First Four poll delivered, even if the games in championship week did not. After the top teams mostly all impressed in a weekend where the average power five conference championship game margin was 32 points (and that includes Florida State&#x27;s 37-35 win over Georgia Tech), it seems our panel couldn&#x27;t make up its mind. One point separates first place and third place in our final poll of the seeason. Alabama and Oregon tied for No. 1 -- both jumping previous No. 1 and still unbeaten Florida State -- and Alabama gets the top spot by virtue of having more first-place votes. The Tide and Ducks each receive 117 points and FSU has 116. FSU had the most first-place votes, six, but was consistently further down in the vote of other voters, reflecting recent opinions of the committee. Alabama had five first-place votes, Oregon two. The vote was similarly close for the the fourth and final playoff spot as Ohio State took the fourth spot with 80 points, one point more than Baylor and just four more than TCU. Here&#x27;s how the vote went: ====== 1. Alabama (117 points), 12-1 Previous rank: No. 2 Last week: def. Missouri, 42-13, in SEC championship game. Projected playoff position: vs. Ohio State in the Sugar Bowl. The playoff committee&#x27;s top team put its foot on the gas to blow out Missouri in a way Florida State has not done in a long time. The Crimson Tide looked like a complete team, frustrating Missouri quarterback Maty Mauk while dominating on offense both on the ground with Derrick Henry and through the air with Blake Sims. Big bad Bama looks ready to make its run. 2. Oregon (117), 12-1 Previous rank: No. 3 Last week: def. Arizona, 51-13, in Pac-12 championship game Projected playoff position: vs. Florida State in the Rose Bowl. In a weekend full of blowouts, Oregon&#x27;s 51-13 rout of the nation&#x27;s highest-ranked two-loss team, Arizona, took the cake. The nation knew what it was getting from Marcus Mariota and the high-powered Ducks offense, but the dominant performance by the Ducks&#x27; defense against a pretty good Arizona offense was a bit of a surprise. 3. Florida State (116 points), 13-0 Previous rank: No. 1 Last week: def. Georgia Tech, 37-35, in ACC championship game. Projected playoff position: vs. Oregon in the Rose Bowl. We came so close to having the committee&#x27;s No. 4 team last week finish No. 1. Just a point separated Alabama and Oregon from FSU. Several of our voters can&#x27;t see voting FSU less than No. 1 when it&#x27;s the only unbeaten team in the country, is the defending national champion and has won 29 games in a row. Hey, how can any committee vote against a team with players as clutch as Jameis Winston and Roberto Aguayo? 4. Ohio State (80), 12-1 Previous rank: No. 6 Projected playoff position: vs. Alabama in the Sugar Bowl. Last week: def. Wisconsin, 59-0, in the Big Ten championship game. Certainly, the committee can&#x27;t punish Ohio State for not having quarterback J.T. Barrett healthy, right? Not after Cardale Jones led the Buckeyes to the rout of what was a weekend of championship game routs around the country. And how about the Buckeyes&#x27; defense? Joey Bosa and the gang looked like a group capable of challenging Alabama&#x27;s potent offense. ====== 5. Baylor (79), 11-1 Previous rank: No. 5 Last week: def. Kansas State, 38-28. Could Baylor really be punished because it was challenged more severely than any contending team not named Florida State? A tough win over a Kansas State team also playing for first place in the Big 12 seemed to do the Bears in with our panel, but barely. 6. TCU (76), 11-1 Previous rank: No. 3 Last week: def. Iowa State, 55-3. This panel&#x27;s a tough crowd, isn&#x27;t it, TCU? You were ranked No. 3 last week, go out and just batter poor Iowa State, and drop three spots in the vote. That&#x27;s what happens when the dust clears and the five teams ahead of you are the five conference champions. The committee says conference championships matter. Evidently they do to our panel too. 7. Mississippi State (45), 10-2 Previous rank: NR Last week: Did not play With two-loss teams going 0-4 in the major conference championships (plus two-loss Kansas State losing to Baylor), we were back to non-division winners returning to the top eight. And it&#x27;s appropriate for the Bulldogs, the second-best team in the best division of college football, to top the list. 8. Michigan State (43), 10-2 Previous rank: No. 8 Last week: Did not play",

(Streeter Lecka/Getty Images) PISCATAWAY — Shortly after it was announced that Rutgers would face North Carolina in the Quick Lane Bowl on Dec. 26, Kyle Flood admitted he wasn&#x27;t particularly familiar with the opponent. The Scarlet Knights coach will get up to speed quickly, as he already had obtained film on the Tar Heels by the time his Sunday evening press conference concluded. While we have almost three weeks to dig deep on North Carolina, here are five things to introduce you to the Tar Heels: 1. An up-and-down season The Tar Heels&#x27; season was full of ebbs and flows. UNC (6-6, 4-4 ACC) was destroyed by East Carolina, 70-41, on Sept. 20, which started a four-game losing streak. They rebounded with a 48-43 win over Georgia Tech, who won the ACC Coastal Division. North Carolina added wins over two more bowl-eligible teams – Pittsburgh and Duke – before getting trounced, 35-7, by North Carolina State in the regular season finale. UNC has an explosive offense, which has produced 40 or more points in six games. The Tar Heels ranked 34th nationally scoring with an average of 34.3 point per game. The defense was porous, allowing 35-plus points in seven games. The Heels ranked 116th in the nation in points allowed (38.9 points per game). 2. A third-year coach on the other sideline Like Flood, North Carolina coach Larry Fedora is in his third season. Fedora took over at UNC in 2012 after leading Southern Mississippi to a 34-19 record and four bowls in four seasons. 4. New Jersey imports There are five New Jersey natives on the North Carolina roster, led by Jack Tabb and Dajaun Drennon. Tabb, a senior tight end from Red Bank, had 21 catches for 206 yards and two touchdowns in the regular season. Drennon, a redshirt freshman defensive end from Clementon, had 36 tackles, 5.5 tackles for loss and 2 sacks in the regular season. Sophomore linebacker Dan Mastromatteo, an Absecon native, played in 11 games and recorded four tackles. Sophomore tackle John Ferranto (Burlington) and redshirt freshman guard Brad Henson (Surf City) round out the New Jersey contingent on the Tar Heels roster. Every player but Ferranto had an offer from Rutgers out of high school. Sicklerville native Greg Webb spent one year at North Carolina, but is set to transfer to Rutgers after spending the semester at Hutchinson (Kan.) Community College. Rutgers freshman defensive end Sam Blue is a Raleigh, N.C., native. 5. The Savon Huggins sweepstakes Rutgers beat North Carolina in one of the biggest recruiting battles in its history. Five-star running back Savon Huggins&#x27; decision came down to Rutgers and North Carolina in 2011. The St. Peter&#x27;s Prep product pulled a fast one on the Tar Heels, first revealing a North Carolina hat at his announcement. After a few seconds, Huggins removed the North Carolina hat to reveal a Rutgers hat.",

(Carlos Osorio | AP Photo) PISCATAWAY — In the days leading up Selection Sunday, there was plenty of speculation that Quick Lane Bowl representatives would aim for the available Big Ten team closest in proximity to Detroit. It&#x27;s why many bowl projections pegged Illinois for the Motor City while conventional wisdom had Rutgers falling to the last Big Ten-affiliated bowl on the board, the Heart of Dallas Bowl. Instead, Quick Lane Bowl reps decided to pick Rutgers on Sunday evening, matching up the 7-5 Scarlet Knights against Atlantic Coast Conference-foe North Carolina in a Dec. 26 affair at Ford Field. &quot;Our focus is on having the best matchup,&#x27;&#x27; Detroit Lions team president Tom Lewand, who also serves as chief executive officer of the inaugural Quick Lane Bowl, told NJ Advance Media. &quot;We also know that we&#x27;re in this for the long haul. This isn&#x27;t a one-year proposition for us. We&#x27;re building a relationship with as many of the Big Ten institutions that we possibly can. There were some really, really strong Big Ten candidates. We just felt the combination of Rutgers and North Carolina was a good one. &quot;And being able to share the Detroit story with a market as large as the New Jersey/New York market is important when we look at the Quick Lane Bowl as a community asset and being able to welcome the media, the student athletes, their families and all of the Rutgers fans. I think we&#x27;ve got a good story to tell, and hopefully when we leave here on the 26th they&#x27;re going to have a really good feeling about the hospitality of Detroiters, some good things that we&#x27;re doing here, and about the pride that we have in our community.&#x27;&#x27; Lewand said his committee communicated with Rutgers officials, including Athletics Director Julie Hermann and coach Kyle Flood, throughout last week, exchanging relevant information and discussing the possible scenarios on what could transpire on what proved to be an eventful Selection Sunday. In addition to finishing 7-5 overall, the Scarlet Knights won three of their eight Big Ten games and surpassed lowly preseason expectations by finishing fourth in the conference&#x27;s East Division. &quot;We&#x27;re excited about having Rutgers,&#x27;&#x27; Lewand said. &quot;I think (it helps) that it&#x27;s the &quot;Birthplace of College Football&#x27;&#x27; and there&#x27;s some serious tradition there. Even though they&#x27;re new to the Big Ten, they&#x27;re obviously not new to the game of college football. So to have a good, traditional blue-collar town come into historical Big Ten country here in Detroit. I just think it&#x27;s a great matchup. I think it&#x27;s a great way to welcome Rutgers to the Big Ten by having them in our backyard. &quot;They had a good year. They obviously won some big games. They beat Michigan out there. That was a huge win and then obviously the huge comeback win to beat Maryland to end the season. A great testament to them to have the 7-5 record and I think it&#x27;ll be a good matchup with North Carolina.",

(William Perlman | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com) The Rutgers football team experienced success on the field and in the classroom in its first season in the Big Ten. The Scarlet Knights (7-5 overall) finished fourth in the Big Ten East Division with a 3-5 conference record. They will face North Carolina in the Quick Lane Bowl in Detroit on Dec. 26. The Scarlet Knights were even more competitive in the classroom. Rutgers placed 27 players on the Academic All-Big Ten team, which tied Illinois and Wisconsin for the third-most honorees. Northwestern led the conference with 37 football players on the Academic All-Big Ten team and Minnesota was second with 30. To be eligible for Academic All-Big Ten selection, student-athletes must be letterwinners who are in at least their second academic year at their institution and carry a cumulative grade point average of 3.0 or higher. The success in the classroom pays off for coach Kyle Flood. Flood&#x27;s contract includes a $25,000 annual bonus if the team has a cumulative GPA of 2.6 or better for players on scholarship. He also receives a $25,000 annual bonus if the team&#x27;s Annual Progress Rate (APR) is 950 or better. The team had a GPA of 2.96 last fall and a 980 APR in the most recent NCAA report. Overall, Rutgers placed 77 fall student-athletes on the Academic All-Big Team. Football had the most selections, followed by women&#x27;s soccer with 15. Two Rutgers athletes achieved perfect 4.0 GPAs: Field hockey player Nicole Imbriaco and women&#x27;s soccer player Margaret Morash.

      "full": "PISCATAWAY — If you judged strictly by statistics, Rutgers tight end Tyler Kroft doesn&#x27;t appear to have improved his NFL stock this season. Kroft was named an honorable mention All-America by SI.com last season after catching 43 passes for 573 yards and four touchdowns in former offensive coordinator Ron Prince&#x27;s system. Kroft followed that breakout campaign with 23 catches for 247 yards and no touchdowns this season under offensive coordinator Ralph Friedgen. But the redshirt junior doesn&#x27;t believe the numbers tell the full story. &quot;I feel like if you put on the tape you&#x27;ll see that it really wasn&#x27;t a step back by any means,&quot; Kroft said. &quot;Coach Prince&#x27;s offense is obviously very tight end-friendly. Coach Friedgen likes to get it to a lot of different guys. There&#x27;s benefits to both. Football is a team game and I think I did my job to the best of my ability this year.&quot; Kroft will find out if NFL talent evaluators share his view, as he applied for a grade from the NFL Draft Advisory Board. Kroft will weigh that review and input from Friedgen and head coach Kyle Flood to make a decision about his future after the season concludes with the Quick Lane Bowl on Dec. 26. The deadline for underclassmen to declare for the draft is Jan. 15. &quot;It&#x27;s been on my mind, but I&#x27;ve just been trying to focus on this season,&quot; Kroft said. &quot;Obviously I have to make a pretty big decision in the next couple of weeks. I&#x27;ll sit down with my family and we&#x27;ll just figure it out then.&quot; Although he wasn&#x27;t featured as much in Friedgen&#x27;s offense, Kroft believes he improved this season. &quot;I think it&#x27;s like night and day from last year,&quot; Kroft said. &quot;I think last year in Coach Prince&#x27;s offense it was more of a tight end-friendly, spread &#x27;em out, get them all on the field, which I like a lot. This year, I was in-line a lot more and my job was more primarily blocking. I think to be a complete tight end, which is what I want to be, I need to put on another 10-15 pounds and still be able to move well, but I think I definitely held my own, especially against the bigger competition this year.&quot; Kroft&#x27;s efforts were recognized by the coaching staff, as he earned the Loyal Knight Award at Sunday&#x27;s banquet. Kroft admitted that he was shocked to win the award, which is presented to the player who displayed great character in sacrificing personal goals for the good of the team. &quot;It was nice to get a little recognition because coaches say week-in and week-out, &#x27;Keep doing your job, keep playing hard and good things will happen,&#x27; &quot; Kroft said. &quot;So it was good. I know everyone kind of gets hung up on numbers, but I think if you turn on the tape you&#x27;ll see me playing hard and doing my job.&quot; The 6-foot-6 Kroft weighed 225 pounds when he arrived at Rutgers in 2011 from Downingtown East (Pa.) High. He&#x27;s up to 242-43 pounds and hopes to be over 250 pounds by next season. It just remains to be seen if that next season will be at Rutgers or in the NFL. &quot;I definitely think I&#x27;m better, especially since last year,&quot; Kroft said. &quot;I definitely think I&#x27;m better suited for the NFL, but obviously I&#x27;m not going to make a decision for a couple of weeks.&quot; Dan Duggan may be reached at dduggan@njadvancemedia.com.

      "full": "LD D3 NEWS LARINI RUTGERS29 S.1 Readers believe that Frank Burns, who was both a Rutgers head coach and a player, has been overlooked. (NJ Advance Media File Photo) Well, I did say it was impossible, and based on the volume of passionate e-mail on the difficult choice picking the Mount Rushmore of Rutgers football, it&#x27;s clear that I was right. So with the Big Ten Network unveiling the four players selected in an online fan poll at 6 p.m. tonight, I thought a quick mailbag with some of the best responses was in order. And they were all very good. Again: Feel free to write me anytime at spoliti@njadvancemedia.com, on this topic or any other, or find me on Twitter @StevePoliti. Now, onto your choices … Coach Frank Burns is missed here and while its difficult to say who comes off, he deserves at least a mention in your articles. He was the one who set the stage for Rutgers moving from an Ivy League type football program to something else, and while I remain mixed about the amount of effort and dollars that have transformed the Rutgers football program (much like my father did years ago), there is something about remembering our history. – Eugene B. Dear Eugene: You make a great point. Burns, who died in 2012 at age 84, was 84-52-2 at Rutgers and led the Scarlet Knights to an undefeated season and their first bowl. Interestingly, while BTN is allowing only former players, Burns could&#x27;ve been an exception. He was the Rutgers quarterback from 1945 to 1948, completing 117 of 270 passes for 2,389 yards and 35 touchdowns with a 27–7 career record. In today&#x27;s column listing your Mt. Rushmore choices I think there is a serious omission. Billy Austin, the captain of the 1958 team, was also a Heisman candidate; and he might have won it if Rutgers had not lost to the Quantico Marines by one point in the final game of the season. Billy did not play in that game because he had a broken hand. In referring to that team, Alex Kroll was quoted as saying, “It was Billy Austin&#x27;s team.” So, might you consider including him? – Aaron N. Dear Aaron: This has been a fantastic history lesson, since I was unaware of Kroll&#x27;s quote about his teammate. Austin finished with 197 points, well shy of Army halfback Pete Dawkins&#x27; 1394-point winning total, in Heisman voting that year. Still: Can you imagine his place in Rutgers football had he won it? It&#x27;s got to be Paul Robeson, Knoll, (Ray) Rice and College Football Hall of Famer Homer Hazel: If recent events disqualify Rice, go with Deron Cherry who probably had the most distinguished NFL career of any RU alum before Ray, and who may have an outside chance to make the Pro Football Hall of Fame someday. — Rob M. Dear Rob: Hazel gets a vote from longtime columnist Jerry Izenberg, a man who has seen a few more games that most of us (and Izenberg believes he belongs ahead of Kroll). Hard to imagine that Cherry was undrafted, isn&#x27;t it, given his pro career? I do wonder if his great pro career – he had 50 career interceptions in the NFL – inflates what he did in college a bit. Still, he was the best choice from that generation.",

From off the field trouble to unscrupulous morals to fan outrage over deplorable behavior, the following group felt the wrath of sports fanatics in New Jersey over the last year. <i>Kevin Manahan | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com</i> <b>Ray Rice </b> Ray Rice, and his wife, Janay, were put in the national spotlight after TMZ released surveillance footage of the former Rutgers star punching his then girlfriend in an Atlantic City elevator. After the video was made public, the Baltimore Ravens released Rice and the NFL revoked his two-game suspension for an indefinite absence from the game. After winning an appeal against the league in November, Rice was reinstated. Through Week 15, no team had signed the free agent. (Kenneth K. Lam | Baltimore Sun) <b>Roger Goodell</b> Roger Goodell&#x27;s popularity among NFL fans plummeted in 2014. From the Ray Rice video release to domestic violence issues around the sport, his league was known more for violence than on-field excellence over the last year.<br/><br/>Furthermore, the leader of the sport came off incompetent in his handling of domestic violence throughout the year. From incompetent to egregious, his discipline decisions often lacked tact or common sense. <i>Randy Miller | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com</i> <b>Adrian Peterson</b> Minnesota Vikings running back Adrian Peterson went from NFL All-Pro to a divisive figure after his indictment on child abuse charges in Texas. Unlike the Ray Rice situation, debate took place around Peterson&#x27;s actions and what constituted acceptable discipline of a child. Ultimately, the NFL shelved Peterson&#x27;s entire season. As a lawsuit commenced against the NFL, the best back in the sport will likely return in 2015 on a different team and with a permanently stained reputation for using a switch to leave welts on a four-year old child. (AP Photo | Pat Sullivan) <b>Donald Sterling</b> The NBA was turned upside down in April when an audio recording of then Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling was released by TMZ. During a conversation with his girlfriend, Sterling made racist remarks that threatened the integrity and business of the NBA. Days later, Sterling was suspended for life and fined $2.5 million by NBA commissioner Adam Silver. <i> Eliot Shorr-Parks & A.J. Perez/NJ.com </i> <b>DeSean Jackson</b> Much like the Eagles&#x27; decision to release the star player last March, DeSean Jackson&#x27;s inclusion on this list is controversial. When an NJ.com story broke about Jackson&#x27;s gang connections serving as a source of friction between player and team, the icing on the cake was ready to emerge. <br/><br/>Within an hour, Jackson was released. From Eagles star to division rival, the mercurial star is still a source of debate around the team. For many Eagles fans, he was a villain both before and after his release.

      "next_sentence_true": "Rutgers went 8-5 in its first Big Ten season, and rebounded with a strong 3-1 finish after getting crushed during a three-game stretch against conference powerhouses.",
      "full": "DETROIT — As expected, Rutgers faced little resistance from North Carolina&#x27;s porous defense in the Quick Lane Bowl on Friday. The surprise was the dominant performance by the Scarlet Knights&#x27; defense in a 40-21 win. The surprisingly dominant victory was a fitting end to a season that exceeded most outside expectations. Rutgers went 8-5 in its first Big Ten season, and rebounded with a strong 3-1 finish after getting crushed during a three-game stretch against conference powerhouses. Before looking ahead to the offseason, here&#x27;s one last look back at the season finale. Before kickoff, I identified five keys to the game. Here&#x27;s a review of how things played out: 1. Contain UNC quarterback Marquise Williams Rutgers coach Kyle Flood said minimizing the versatile Williams&#x27; impact was the key to the game. The Scarlet Knights checked that box, as Williams was held in check as Rutgers built an insurmountable lead. Williams completed 25-of-37 passes for 198 yards and a touchdown, as he settled for a series of check-downs. Williams was a bigger threat as a runner, but he was limited to 51 yards on 15 carries. Rutgers only sacked Williams once, but he was constantly under pressure. Williams had to work for everything, as Rutgers did a good job setting the edge and eliminating opportunities for big plays. 2. Pound the ball against UNC&#x27;s porous defense Sometimes the simple answer is the best one. Offensive coordinator Ralph Friedgen didn&#x27;t get fancy, as he simply pounded the ball all day against UNC&#x27;s soft defense. The result was 340 yards rushing, which represents the program&#x27;s highest total since 2007. Freshman Josh Hicks was dominant, carrying 19 times for 202 yards and one touchdown. Classmate Robert Martin was an excellent complement, adding 100 yards and two touchdowns on 19 carries. Even quarterback Gary Nova got involved, picking up a career-high 30 yards on two carries. The ground attack allowed Rutgers to control the clock and the game. 3. Hit big plays in the passing game North Carolina&#x27;s defense was as bad as advertised. While the running game shredded the Tar Heels, quarterback Gary Nova was able to pick his spots for big plays. Nova completed just 9-of-20 passes, but he totaled 184 yards, two touchdowns and no interceptions. Nova&#x27;s 20.4 yards per completion was expected considering UNC was susceptible to big plays in the passing game all season. Nova connected on five passes of 20 or more yards, including picture-perfect 34-yard touchdown strikes to Andrew Turzilli and Andre Patton and a beautiful 23-yard toss to Leonte Carroo. Nova completed only two passes in the second half and came dangerously close to interceptions on three ill-advised throws. But with the rushing attack rolling and the game in hand, Nova wasn&#x27;t called upon to do much in the second half. 4. Avoid mistakes on special teams Special teams was a mixed bag. Kicker Kyle Federico, who had been questionable with an upper body injury and was sporting a shiner under his left eye, made two short field goals, but missed an extra point. Punter Joey Roth was great when he had protection, averaging 44.7 yards on three punts. But he had a first-quarter punt blocked when Steve Longa was beat off the right edge. Rutgers limited dangerous punt returner Ryan Switzer to five yards on three returns. Long snapper Alan Lucy continued his adventurous freshman season, nearly airmailing a snap on a point-after, but Mike Bimonte bailed him out with a great catch and hold. UNC&#x27;s kicking game was as shaky as expected, as Lorenzo Waters blocked a 31-yard attempt and Darius Hamilton stuffed a fake field goal on a 22-yard attempt. Rutgers also converted a fake punt on a direct snap to Michael Burton on fourth-and-1 early in the third quarter. The kicking struggles weren&#x27;t much of a factor considering the lopsided score. 5. Keep up with UNC&#x27;s fast pace Rutgers had its best plan of the season against an up-tempo offense. There was no scrambling to get set like there had been at times during the regular season. Credit the coaching staff with having substitution packages ready and getting the calls in quickly. More importantly, the players executed the plan. The key to slowing Carolina&#x27;s offense was getting off the field, and the Tar Heels were just 6-for-16 on third down. The Scarlet Knights also came up with two turnovers to halt first-half drives. Dan Duggan may be reached at dduggan@njadvancemedia.com. Follow him on Twitter @DDuggan21.

      "full": "Rutgers football faces UNC in Quick Lane Bowl Athletic Director Julie Hermann talks to fans in the pre-game tailgate party as Rutgers football faces North Carolina in the Quick Lane Bowl at Ford Field. 12/26/14 Detroit, MI (John Munson | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com) (John Munson) Jason Baum showed up for his final day of work at Rutgers while passing a kidney stone. He left the emergency room in the early afternoon in Detroit, loaded up on pain killers that did not appear to be doing the job, and made it to Ford Field an hour before kickoff to ask the stunned radio and TV broadcasters if they had any questions. No one would have said a word had he retreated to the team hotel and ordered room service on company dime. Instead, he cut the hospital bracelet off his wrist and started tweeting enthusiastically about the big Rutgers victory. “I question his toughness a little bit,” head coach Kyle Flood joked in his postgame news conference, “but I don’t question his dedication to the program, that’s for sure.” That&#x27;s the life of a sports information director – a thankless, 24/7 job negotiating between media and coaches who often have opposite agendas. Baum filled that role for nine years and 116 straight football games at Rutgers, dealing not only with requests and questions from major news outlets but average fans on social media. That ended after the Quick Lane Bowl. Baum, who sent an email to people who cover the team regularly explaining that he had resigned, would not comment about the circumstances of his departure. But everyone around the athletic department knows he was forced out, one of the first — but almost certainly not the last — casualties under athletic director Julie Hermann. Hermann, according to multiple sources at Rutgers who didn&#x27;t want to be named for fear of their own jobs, made Baum the fall guy for her own collection of media gaffes. Essentially, Hermann couldn&#x27;t fire the media so she fired the media guy, and the departure of the popular SID left many in the department stunned and angry. Asked for a statement on Baum&#x27;s departure, Hermann, through spokesman Tom Luicci, said this: “We thank Jason for his many years of service and wish him luck in his future endeavors.” It&#x27;s clear that Luicci, who was hired in April after years covering Rutgers for The Star-Ledger, teamed with Hermann to throw Baum overboard in a power struggle for control of the communications department. “It&#x27;s hard to see him go, man,” Eric LeGrand, the paralyzed football player turned broadcaster, said of Baum. “Pretty much anything I needed at Rutgers, Jay was my guy. He always did me right when I was there. He always put the program first and did his job to the best of his abilities.” LeGrand&#x27;s mother, Karen, was in tears when she heard the news that Baum was leaving, and it&#x27;s easy to understand why. Baum was the first line of defense when her son was in intensive care early after the injury. “He protected me and my family from all the different news cameras that were offered money to nurses and stuff,” LeGrand said. Look, I didn&#x27;t always agree with Baum during his nine years here, nor did he always agree with what I wrote. The relationship between a communications director at a Division I university and a sports columnist is going to be confrontational at times. But I never doubted his professionalism and certainly not his work ethic, and I never felt that he was doing anything but protecting the place where he worked. And that&#x27;s what makes this decision so incredible, really. I&#x27;ve racked my brain trying to come up with a controversy involving something a football player said to the media over the past nine years, and I&#x27;ve asked others who cover the team more closely, and no one came up with anything. Nine years, and not one fire to put out involving the often immature college students in the football program, and that&#x27;s because Baum briefed every player on talking points before they sat down for interviews. Many have carried that professionalism in dealing with the media to the NFL, with several of them tweeting their support for Baum in the past 24 hours. Think about the contrast, then, when Hermann took over at Rutgers and made national headlines for all the wrong reasons several times in her first year alone. She was the one hired to be the face of the department, and part of that is dealing with the media. How was any of that Baum&#x27;s fault? What concerns me most — and what should concern fans the most, too — is that Rutgers may now begin limiting access to its programs and players. It has more availability than most major programs, something that Baum recognized was a necessity in the competitive market, but already there are whispers that this will change. That would be a shame, really, because Baum understood the benefits of showcasing the best football players each week to the media, of letting someone like Darius Hamilton or David Milewski not only shine a positive light on the football program, but on the entire university. “Jason gave so much to Rutgers over the past nine years,” radio voice Chris Carlin said. “He always put the student athlete and the Block R first. He never made it about him.” It won&#x27;t be about him now. But it will be telling if the media policies that have helped spotlight Rutgers athletes change in his absence, and if a cordial relationship between the media and the football program becomes confrontational. Then, maybe Hermann will regret the decision to push aside the PR guy who played hurt on his final day of work. Steve Politi may be reached at spoliti@njadvancemedia.com.

At this point they’re no longer reasons for what went awry as Rutgers lost for the fifth time in six games yesterday. They’re excuses. Because that’s what losing teams make. “You lose a lot of sleep when thinking about the things that happen over and over again,” Holmes said after the 28-17 loss at Rentschler Field to a Connecticut team that had been winless before last Saturday. “At the end of the day, as a senior, I have to stay on top of these guys and not let them lose faith. It’s not easy. As a senior, this is your last go-around and you start to get impatient. &quot;But you can’t let it affect what you’re trying to do.&quot; That could be next week — but it didn’t have to be. Rutgers had reclaimed the lead at 17-14 late in the third quarter on Justin Goodwin’s 3-yard touchdown run on a drive set up by an 84-yard completion to Quron Pratt. Given a chance to dig in and make a stop, the defense offered only token resistance as Cochran moved the Huskies 80 yards in eight plays to retake control at 21-17. When the defense needed to hold late in the fourth quarter, UConn drove 56 yards for the clinching score on a third-down touchdown pass by Cochran with 3:04 to play, pushing the Huskies’ advantage to 28-17. &quot;Sometimes you don’t make as many plays as you need to in order to win,&quot; Hamilton said. &quot;There’s a lot of frustration right now. We can’t hide that.&quot;",

I feel we set the standard for how things should be done, what it means to be a Rutgers player on and off the field, how you should conduct yourself as a player here.&quot; Of the 23 scholarship players from that 2009 recruiting class, two (Mohamed Sanu and Logan Ryan) left school with eligibility remaining, 10 were lost through attrition and four (Ka’Lial Glaud, Steve Beauharnais, Duron Harmon and Mark Harrison) left after last season after playing all four years without redshirting. That leaves seven fifth-year guys from 2009 — not counting walk-ons Joe Behnke, Tyler Bellia, Nick DePaola and Robert Jones. &quot;I think it happens a lot around the country,&quot; said tight end Paul Carrezola, one of the seven fifth-year guys. &quot;We had a couple of very good players leave for the NFL Draft, too. But it is kind of funny to see the numbers dwindle as you get older and you look around and there aren’t many guys left that you came in with it.&quot; Fellow fifth-year senior Andre Civil, who owns a total of 24 offensive line starts in an injury-plagued career, said he’s proud to have stuck out all five years. &quot;I’m happy overall with my career,&quot; he said. &quot;There were some bumpy roads in there.

Rutgers, at 5-6, needs to win to become bowl eligible. But a loss sends the Scarlet Knights home until spring practice, and Carrezola, Civil and Pratt may be done playing for good if that happens. An NFL team may look at them, but as Civil understands, &quot;nothing is guaranteed.&quot; &quot;I can’t be concerned with that,&quot; said Pratt, the team’s third-leading receiver with 29 catches. &quot;Just being here has been a blessing.

Although inexperienced at the game of football, the Milford (N.Y.) Academy standout displays in his recently released highlights the ability to be a highly effective football player at the BCS level.

Fuchs also appears to encompass above average speed for either the tight end or h-back positions. <b>Strengths</b> For a big receiver, Fuchs does a good job selling his routes.

His basketball background has propelled him to work the box-out technique as well as out-jump linebackers for the football. Fuchs can also take a good hit and maintain possession of the football. Fuchs works to gain initial leverage during passing downs. He can decelerate and re-accelerate well, allowing opportunities for yardage after the catch.

(Ed Murray/The Star-Ledger) Jamil Merrell gave a speech as the best man at his twin brother’s wedding in August, and Jamal Merrell remembers it as the greatest he has ever heard. Jamil retold the story of how Jamal met his wife, Alicia Marie, when they went bowling together. The brothers, 23, had spent their entire lives together, but now Jamal is married, with a 3-year old daughter and a home waiting for him in the brothers’ native Delaware. Today may mark another turning point in their close relationship. Rutgers (5-6) plays its final regular-season game at 7:30 against South Florida. A win earns a trip to a bowl game. A loss ends the season. And for the Merrells, fraternal twins and redshirt seniors, it could be the last time they play football together, the end of a shared journey. &quot;It&#x27;s a humbling one, a long one, we&#x27;ve been through a lot of ups and downs,&quot; Jamal said. &quot;For this to be (perhaps) my last game, it&#x27;s like, unreal.&quot; For their entire lives, the Merrells say they have been nearly inseparable. Leaving Hodgson Vo-Tech High School in Newark, DE, they never even considered going to different colleges, choosing to share their experiences together. Jamil says they have been roommates for 23 years and still share an apartment. Teammates can barely recollect seeing them apart. They were both two-way players in high school, Jamil at defensive end and tight end, Jamal at wide receiver and free safety. On defense, they were energetic – so much so that Frank Moffett, their coach, had to sometimes tell them to slow down. Between the two of them, Moffett believes, they caused 8-10 concussions in teammates with their big hits in practice. At Rutgers, they slowly developed into key players. Jamal Merrell began his career as a receiver but after injuring his knee asked Greg Schiano, then the coach, to move him to defense. By 2011 they became starters on defense together, creating a link that Jamil struggled to define. &quot;We just know,&quot; he said. &quot;It&#x27;s kind of like a twin thing: we just know. Him being on the same side of me, you know you got back up – real backup behind you. It&#x27;s a good thing for this team.&quot; Despite the similarities, there is much to separate the two. At Hodgson, Moffett says the brothers were called &quot;Fatty&quot; – Jamil— and &quot;Skinny&quot;— Jamal.",

      "full": "TD.JPG Rutgers finally had something to celebrate on Saturday, beating South Florida, 31-6, to clinch a bowl berth. (Ed Murray/The Star-Ledger) If only Rutgers could bring South Florida along to the Pinstripe Bowl. With a 31-6 win over USF, Rutgers became bowl eligible and is expected to face Notre Dame on Dec. 28 at Yankee Stadium. The Scarlet Knights found the cure for their many ailments in the form of the 2-10 Bulls. Rutgers&#x27; beleaguered defense had its best performance in weeks and the offense was led by quarterback Chas Dodd and running back Paul James. Here are some quick-hit thoughts from the win: --The cornerback play improved significantly. Rutgers has mixed-and-matched its corners all season, and the combination of Gareef Glashen and Anthony Cioffi got the call against USF. Glashen had an interception of a poorly thrown Mike White pass late in the second quarter to give Rutgers the ball at USF&#x27;s 22-yard line. Glashen and Cioffi both were solid in run support. Cioffi had a highlight-worthy stick of Marcus Shaw in the first quarter, flipping the USF running back over his shoulder with a perfect tackle at the line of scrimmage. --The praise of Rutgers&#x27; secondary can be tempered somewhat by the fact that USF&#x27;s passing attack was dreadful. White is the Bulls&#x27; fourth quarterback of the season and the true freshman clearly has a long way to go. He never should have thrown the pass that Glashen intercepted and he failed to exploit the weaknesses in Rutgers&#x27; secondary. The game plan can be blamed for some of the ineffectiveness, as the Bulls failed to attack the middle of the field consistently. Rutgers has struggled to cover that area and bubble screens, yet USF didn&#x27;t challenge the Scarlet Knights with either. --The Rutgers offense looks completely different when it has a healthy Paul James carrying the load. The running back suffered a left leg injury last week against UConn and was questionable for this game, but he was healthy enough to carry 26 times for 113 yards and two touchdowns. James did what he always does: Hit the hole hard, make the proper cuts and fight for extra yardage. He was the workhorse on Rutgers&#x27; game-sealing drive in the fourth quarter, touching the ball on eight straight plays. The 14-play, 69-yard drive ended on a 1-yard TD run by James. James had a hand in 12 plays for 58 yards. James did have a costly turnover, as he fumbled at the USF 1-yard line and the Bulls recovered in the end zone late in the first quarter. --The offensive line deserves a share of the credit for the running game. On James&#x27; two touchdown runs of five yards and one yard, he wasn&#x27;t even touched thanks to huge holes. The return of Betim Bujari from a three-game absence with an ankle injury made a difference. Bujari, who had been the starting center, moved in at right guard next to center Dallas Hendrikson.",

(Ed Murray/The Star-Ledger) This is a regular feature after every Rutgers game where I take a look at who improved his stock with a strong game and who headed in the opposite direction with a poor performance. Here&#x27;s the &#x27;stock watch&#x27; from Saturday&#x27;s 31-6 win over South Florida. <p>1. Quarterback Chas Dodd Dodd gave Rutgers exactly what it needed on Saturday night. The senior quarterback was poised and efficient, completing 19-of-24 passes for 179 yards, two touchdowns and no interceptions. Dodd&#x27;s ceiling is evident, but his floor also appears to be much higher than Gary Nova, who was susceptible to turnover meltdowns as the starter for the first 10 games of the season. Dodd has mostly made good decisions since taking over as the starter last week and he didn&#x27;t have a turnover against South Florida. Dodd did a good job finding open receivers and he didn&#x27;t force plays that weren&#x27;t there. Dodd was sacked twice, but he avoided a number of others by getting out the pocket. The best aspect of Dodd&#x27;s mobility is his ability to find receivers while on the move. He connected on an easy 2-yard TD pass to fullback Michael Burton late in the first half after scrambling out of the pocket. <p>2. Tight end Tyler Kroft You likely would have won a bar bet if you wagered on Kroft to be the team&#x27;s leading receiver before the season. But that&#x27;s exactly what the sophomore tight end has done, catching 40 passes passes for 530 yards and four touchdowns. As a freshman last year, Kroft had three catches for 59 yards and a TD. Kroft emerged as a reliable option in an inconsistent passing attack. It didn&#x27;t matter if Nova or Dodd was under center, the one constant was Kroft open over the middle to move the chains. Kroft had three catches for 51 yards against South Florida, and nearly had two touchdowns. He was tackled at the 1/2 yard-line after a 16-yard gain late in the first quarter and he was stopped at the 2 after a 24-yard reception late in the second quarter. <p>3. Cornerback Gareef Glashen It was nearly impossible to limit this category to just three names. A number of players were in contention for a spot, including middle linebacker Steve Longa (team-high seven tackles), running back Paul James (26 carries for 113 yards and two TDs), defensive tackle Darius Hamilton (fumble recovery, sack, generally disruptive force) and wide receiver Andre Patton (12-yard TD catch). Realistically, every player on defense and the entire offensive line merited consideration.",

The Irish have outscored Rutgers 197-17 in the four matchups, including a 42-0 win in the most recent meeting in 2002.

Rutgers graduation rate (85 percent) for football players is tied for ninth and Notre Dame (94 percent) is tied for second out of the 70 bowl teams. Rice, which will play in the AutoZone Liberty Bowl, has the top football graduation rate at 96 percent, according to an annual report released Monday by The Institute for Diversity and Ethics in Sport (TIDES). &quot;Playing Rutgers for us at Notre Dame also brings another thing to light, and that is two universities that show great graduation rates,&quot; Notre Dame coach Brian Kelly said in a press conference at Yankee Stadium on Tuesday. &quot;When we&#x27;re putting together a schedule and we&#x27;re looking for opponents, I think you&#x27;re looking for those that have quality graduation rates as well. We respect the fact that Rutgers has high graduation rates, as we do. I think we have two here that are going to boast high graduation rates in playing a bowl game. That&#x27;s very important.&quot; The Pinstripe Bowl committee selected Rutgers (6-6) over Houston (8-4) to face Notre Dame. Houston beat Rutgers, 49-14, when the teams met in Piscataway on Oct. 26.

The Rutgers football team has a graduation rate of 85 percent for African-American players and 88 percent for white players. Notre Dame has a graduation rate of 97 percent for African-American players and 89 percent for white players. Among bowl schools, the average graduation rate for African-American football players is 65 percent compared to 84 percent for whites.",

      "full": "NEW YORK — Even now, four days later, the performance remains as perplexing as it was impressive. For most of Rutgers’ six games prior to Saturday, there wasn’t a hint of a team that was bowl-worthy. Five of those were uninspired, mistake-filled losses. Then came the dominant effort against South Florida, a game coach Kyle Flood called his team’s &quot;most complete game of the season,&quot; and it was a head-scratcher in this regard: Where did it come from? &quot;I think our players responded to what ultimately could have been the finality of our situation had that game gone the other way,&quot; Flood said following the formal proceedings from Tuesday’s Pinstripe Bowl press conference at Yankee Stadium, where the Scarlet Knights will face Notre Dame on Dec. 28. &quot;I think that created an urgency level at an unprecedented height for our program. I think we played hard in the other games, not always as well as we would’ve liked to, but Saturday night we did.&quot; For those dismissing the lopsided 31-6 victory because it came against a 2-10 USF team led by a true freshman quarterback, know this: Rutgers was lethargic in losing to what was then a 1-9 UConn team the game prior to that, and saw Houston’s true freshman quarterback John O’Korn riddle their defense in late October by going 24-of-30 for 364 yards and five TDs in a 49-14 loss. So it easily could have been another one of those performances. Flood, though, says he does not look back and wonder about what could have been had his team revived itself a few games earlier. &quot;I don’t think of it like that,&quot; he said. &quot;I compartmentalize every week. Once we acknowledge the mistakes we’ve made and we set the plan in place to try to fix them, then we move forward and we don’t look back. &quot;So I don’t look back with any second-guessing on those things.&quot; That USF game, which squared Rutgers’ record at 6-6 and earned the school its eighth bowl invitation in nine years, is what the Scarlet Knights will hang their helmets on as they begin preparations this weekend for an 8-4 Notre Dame team that is a year removed from playing in the BCS championship game.

(John Munson/The Star-Ledger) Paul James treats his injury-marred season much as he does one of the long runs that were his signature plays early in the year: He never looks back. Only straight ahead. But every now and then, Rutgers’ third-year sophomore running back allows himself a brief moment of woulda, coulda, shoulda. &quot;Here and there you let yourself think about what could have been,&quot; James said after the Scarlet Knights’ latest bowl practice Tuesday. &quot;But then you remind yourself that it’s already over. You can’t look back and wonder. I try to look ahead to what I can do because you can’t change the past. &quot;But I admit it. Here and there you think about it.&quot; The starting point for what could have been for James this season is the first four games, when he rushed for 573 yards, was ranked No. 2 nationally in rushing yards per game and had four runs of 50 yards or more. Ray Rice, the greatest back in school history, never had that many in a season. Rutgers had one as a team from 2010 to 2012. &quot;I was definitely thinking the sky is the limit after those first four games,&quot; said James. Everything changed for James — and for the Scarlet Knights — when the former Glassboro High star broke a fibula Sept. 21 against Arkansas. He would miss the next four games and really wasn’t the same again until the season finale against USF when he rushed for 113 yards and two scores. He also missed the second half of the Connecticut game because of a sprained knee. So a year that was headed for rarefied Rice-type production wound up as a solid one — 833 yards and nine rushing TDs on 146 carries — that resulted in first-team all-AAC honors. But it’s easy to wonder &quot;what if?&quot; &quot;He was on his way to doing some special things,&quot; left guard Kaleb Johnson said. James still has a chance for a 1,000-yard season, but it will require going for 167 yards against Notre Dame in the Dec. 28 Pinstripe Bowl at Yankee Stadium. That 1,000-yard mark looked like a cinch after the first four games. &quot;That’s going to be our goal as an offensive line, to get him to 1,000,&quot; said Johnson. James’ penchant for injuries seems to be the only thing holding him back any more. His senior year in high school he suffered a high ankle sprain and had to struggle to get to 1,000 yards — an achievement that failed to impress recruiters. That’s partly why James wound up walking on at Rutgers. And just as he was starting to make an impression in the summer of 2012 he suffered a high ankle sprain the last week of pre-season camp. He was never able to make an impact that year.",

(Jonathan Daniel/Getty Images) On Saturday, Rutgers took the practice field one week away from the Pinstripe Bowl against Notre Dame at Yankee Stadium. The game plan on both sides of the ball for the Fighting Irish was installed, which meant that the prep work truly began in earnest. Scout teams mimicked the movements and motions, trying to simulate what Notre Dame will throw at the Scarlet Knights Saturday. So for a secondary that has struggled against opponents passing games this season, the true task began: Figuring out a way to not let Notre Dame wide receiver T.J. Jones burn it like so many others have. &quot;He’s a good player and he has good speed,&quot; fourth-year junior cornerback Gareef Glashen said. &quot;He goes and gets the ball. I’d say he’s very versatile. That’s why they like to get him the ball as much as possible.&quot; While it might not be the focus publicly, the matchup against Jones is one that Rutgers will need to tilt in its favor. Despite being just 5-foot-11 and 195 pounds, the senior has been Notre Dame’s primary passing target this season. He became just the seventh player in Fighting Irish history to register a 1,000-yard season through the air — 1,042 to be exact — making it only the ninth time ever that a Notre Dame receiver has cracked the barrier. How rare is the feat? Heisman Trophy winner Tim Brown never accomplished it in his four years in South Bend. &quot;I think they’ve had some talented (receivers) in their history,&quot; Rutgers head coach Kyle Flood said. &quot;He’s a very talented player.&quot; As Rutgers has spent the past two weeks studying film of the Fighting Irish, Glashen says what stood out to him about Jones’ skill set is his route-running ability. That even though he’s not the biggest receiver or even the most physical, he puts himself in the right place at the right time for quarterback Tommy Rees. And once that happens, it becomes easy to see how he hauled in nine touchdowns this season. &quot;We’ve got guys like that on our team — (Leonte) Carroo, (Quron) Pratt — not overly big guys,&quot; Glashen said. &quot;Like them, he’s aggressive going up to go get the ball. They don’t wait for it to come to them. And they’re good route-runners. He’s very similar to those guys. But he’s a senior and has a lot of experience, so he’s very comfortable out there.&quot;",

It didn&#x27;t seem necessary for Rutgers to tinker with the offense when it averaged 40 points during a 4-1 start. But over the 1-5 slide that followed, the Scarlet Knights averaged just 16.3 points per game. There were a number of causes for the offense&#x27;s decline – running back Paul James&#x27; four-game absence with a leg injury, quarterback Gary Nova&#x27;s turnover struggles, stiffer competition. But as the offense continued to sputter, there seemed to be a lack of creativity until the zone-read was utilized late in the season. &quot;I think if your offense isn&#x27;t constantly evolving it&#x27;s not good for you,&quot; Rutgers coach Kyle Flood said. &quot;I think for us we want to constantly evolve in the run game and that&#x27;s part of the way we&#x27;ve done it, and we want to continue to evolve in the passing game and I think we&#x27;ve done that through the bowl prep.&quot; Rutgers ran a handful of zone-read plays in a 28-17 loss to UConn on Nov. 30 and did the same in a 31-6 win over South Florida in the regular season finale on Dec. 7. Naturally, Flood and the players have no intention of sharing how much they plan to use the zone-read against Notre Dame in the Pinstripe Bowl on Saturday. But simply adding that element means the Irish will have to devote time to game-planning for the zone-read. &quot;It gives them something more to prepare for,&quot; James said. &quot;It&#x27;s very important because you always want to keep your opponent on their toes and keep them guessing.&quot; The new wrinkle coincided with Chas Dodd taking over at quarterback for Nova. Dodd didn&#x27;t exactly conjure images of Cam Newton in his two starts, but he showed a level of comfort with the zone-read. &quot;I feel like I&#x27;m a fairly mobile quarterback and I&#x27;m able to run a little bit,&quot; Dodd said. &quot;Having the zone-read, that&#x27;s always an option running those types of plays. As far as that goes, I feel like I&#x27;m pretty set for being able to see the different reads.&quot; The most successful play out of the zone-read came against USF when Dodd sold a run action before pulling up to hit tight end Tyler Kroft wide open up the seam for a 24-yard gain. &quot;For Chas, it gives him more options of what he&#x27;s going to do,&quot; James said. &quot;It kind of opens us up to more plays. It gives us more options on one play to throw the defense off track.&quot; Despite possessing size and physicality in its front seven, Notre Dame ranked 75th in the nation against the run, allowing 175.3 rushing yards per game. James, who had 113 yards in the regular season finale, is confident Rutgers will be able to run on the Irish. &quot;They&#x27;re very big and physical, but I just feel like if you do your job, if the linemen do their job and work their fundamentals, it&#x27;s not that hard,&quot; James said. &quot;I feel like they&#x27;re definitely blockable guys. You can see it in each game, where they can be blocked and big holes open up.&quot; Odds are that Rutgers will deploy some zone-read looks against Notre Dame.

      "full": "darius-hamilton.jpg Rutgers defensive tackle Darius Hamilton is second on the team with 4.5 sacks. (Tony Kurdzuk/The Star-Ledger) The Rutgers pass rush has been understandably overlooked during a season in which the defense set a school record for passing yards allowed. But the team averaged 2.7 sacks per game, which ranked 24th in the nation. Pass defense is a complementary process, with a strong pass rush conceivably helping the coverage and vice versa. Things haven&#x27;t worked out that way for Rutgers, so the defensive line may need to do more than its share to contain Notre Dame&#x27;s offense on Saturday in the Pinstripe Bowl. &quot;I feel as though the pass rush has done really well this year,&quot; nose tackle Isaac Holmes said. &quot;Over the years, we&#x27;ve created this tradition of getting after quarterbacks and getting after people with blitzes. Of course, people&#x27;s schemes change. Nobody wants to hold the ball against us. But we showed that when teams like to hold the ball against us we can really get after them and make the quarterback uncomfortable.&quot; Notre Dame&#x27;s line has done an excellent job keeping quarterback Tommy Rees comfortable this season. The Irish allowed only eight sacks in 12 games, tied for the second-lowest total in the nation. The most impressive aspect of the Irish&#x27;s pass protection is that they haven&#x27;t missed a beat despite losing their starting center and both starting guards to injuries during the season. &quot;Those guys are good up front,&quot; Holmes said. &quot;Even though they lost a couple of people in the middle, that&#x27;s a really good unit. That&#x27;s the strength of their offense. Those guys play together really well. It&#x27;s proven over the year. Those guys have great chemistry and they know how to protect their guy.&quot; There&#x27;s no secret to Notre Dame&#x27;s success. With an average size of 6-foot-5, 310 pounds, the Irish come at opponents with size and strength. That brawn creates an apparent mismatch against Rutgers&#x27; front four, which averages 6-foot-4, 265 pounds. &quot;When you see undersized, you think we&#x27;re just going to push these guys around,&quot; defensive tackle Darius Hamilton said. &quot;We welcome anybody to come in and do that. We believe in our schemes and our system and we&#x27;re going to do whatever it takes to get the job done.&quot; Hamilton has been the catalyst for a pass rush that has became more of a factor late in the season. The Scarlet Knights recorded 10 of their 32 sacks in the final three games. Hamilton had 3.5 of his 4.5 sacks during that stretch. The coaching staff&#x27;s hesitancy to unleash Hamilton on third downs has been a head-scratcher, but the sophomore was on the field for passing situations more frequently in the regular season finale win over South Florida. &quot;I&#x27;m really excited about any way I can help this team,&quot; Hamilton said. &quot;Any chance I get to help this team, I&#x27;m running with it 100 percent.&quot; That includes the chance to face one of the best offensive lines in the country. &quot;We&#x27;re going to do whatever we can to get after the quarterback,&quot; Hamilton said. &quot;First, it starts with stopping the run. I know running the ball is something that they want to do. It&#x27;s going to be a battle out there and I&#x27;m excited about it.&quot;",

      "full": "NEW YORK — There was a point during the first half, where Rutgers coach Mike Rice could do nothing but lean back on the rotating ad boards on the sides at Madison Square Garden. Helpless as he watched his team getting run up and down the floor by North Carolina, Rice grabbed his face with his hand in frustration. In the weeks leading up to last night’s game, Rice viewed it as sort of a mid-term for the final exam of the Big East schedule. The result? Not what he had hoped. &quot;This team, they don’t come with the right mind-set and mentality every single day,&quot; Rice said afterwards. &quot;So, now I have them.

I’ll never say that this is going to help, but they’ll learn from it, no question.&quot; In its first real test of the season — and final before Big East play begins on Sunday — the Scarlet Knights were dealt a harsh dose of reality. Against a bigger, stronger, faster and longer North Carolina team, Rutgers was manhandled from the very beginning of a 78-55 loss. &quot;To come out with the performance that we did, it was discouraging and at the same time eye-opening,&quot; forward Jonathan Mitchell said. &quot;We need to get better. Bottom line. We’ve been reading our press clippings too much or maybe looking forward to the process, but no putting in the work to get to the end result. We’ve just got to go back to the drawing board.&quot; Despite Mitchell’s 20 points, Rutgers seemed overmatched from the beginning. Even more so when Carolina’s leading scorer was Leslie McDonald — who came off the bench with 14 points. Just another example of the Tar Heels flexing their muscle. In nearly every way possible, the Scarlet Knights were overmatched. Size? The length of North Carolina’s interior players — Tyler Zeller, John Henson and Harrison Barnes — kept Rutgers playing from the perimeter. The result was a 5-for-22 mark from 3-point range. Athleticism? Yeah, the Tar Heels had that, too. There was the sequences where Barnes went up and over Rutgers’ Mitchell and Gilvydas Biruta for an offensive rebound.

And I’ll make it clear: The only job I want is the one I have right now.” But will Schiano, rumored to be on the hot seat, have a job when the season ends? O&#x27;Brien interviewed with the Philadelphia Eagles and Cleveland Browns last offseason, but returned to Penn State with a new deal, and the school agreed to lower his buyout from $19 million to $6.5 million should he take an NFL head-coaching job, the ESPN report said. ESPN added there have been conversations to further reduce the buyout.",

      "full": "DePaul Catholic&#x27;s 6-2, 235-pound Justin Nelson has FBS athlete written all over him. I covered the Chuck Mound Football Combine back in 2009 when Nelson was only an eighth grader. He was so talented that even though being, by far, the youngest combine participant, he routinely dominated soon-to-be seniors during the one-on-one portion of the combine. Fast forward to 2010 - his freshman year at St. Peter&#x27;s Prep - and head coach Rich Hansen states that Nelson might be the best freshman he has ever coached. And that&#x27;s saying a lot being that Hansen has coached the likes of New York Giants safety, Will Hill, and Rutgers running back, Savon Huggins. However, as a sophomore, Nelson and his family chose to take his talents to DePaul Catholic, a school which he felt was a better fit for him and his family, both academically and football-wise. &quot;I love it at DePaul,&quot; said Nelson. &quot;I really like it up there. It&#x27;s a good environment, its good football-wise, too. We went 5-5 this year. We played in a new conference and were a young team, but we&#x27;ll definitely pick it up. &quot;The coaches there are great. They coach me just as well as any coach from any other school. They help me out academically, too. I love it there. And coach Brian Murray, he&#x27;s the coach that helps out with the recruiting. He&#x27;s really good, helps me out a lot. I don&#x27;t have any complaints about the school.&quot; Nelson has accrued 122 tackles and 22 sacks over the past two seasons since transferring to DePaul Catholic. He has competed exclusively from the defensive end position but plans to make plays as a linebacker, intercollegiately. &quot;I&#x27;m going to probably play the linebacker in college,&quot; said Nelson who encompasses a 315-pound bench press and 600-plus pound squat. &quot;But I can put my hand in the dirt and be a tremendous edge rusher, for sure. Anything my future team needs me to do, I am willing to do it. At the end of the day, I just want to continue to do well academically and win football games.&quot; Although Nelson transferred from prep soon after his freshman year, he and Rich Hansen still maintain a positive relationship. Nelson still considers Hansen a mentor and listens to the positive messages that Hansen continually feeds him, even now. &quot;I love coach Hansen to this day,&quot; said Nelson. &quot;We still keep in contact. He&#x27;s one of the best coaches I&#x27;ve ever had, and I really appreciate everything he ever did for me. He tells me to keep plugging away and don&#x27;t ever give up. Do everything you have to do and you will end up at the school you want to end up at. He&#x27;s a good guy to keep in touch with.&quot; Nelson is scheduled to take part in Rutgers&#x27; bowl game practice tomorrow morning. The Scarlet Knights will face off against Virginia Tech in the Russell Athletic Bowl in Orlando on Dec. 28. &quot;I&#x27;ll be at Rutgers in the morning, around 9,&quot; said Nelson. &quot;They told me it was an invite-only visit for the bowl practice and I needed to come up and spend the day up there.&quot; The powerful edge-rusher has been in constant contact with the Rutgers staff and, according to Nelson, there is a chance that an offer could be coming in the near future. &quot;For the most part, everyday I talk to coach (Dave) Cohen. He comes to my school a lot so we communicate on the regular. He just tells me Rutgers is really interested in me and to stay on top of my grades. &quot;And he tells me that the offer is coming soon,&quot; Nelson continued. &quot;I appreciate him for that. I&#x27;m working hard, I just want that Rutgers offer to roll in.&quot; Although offer-less at this point due to grades Nelson accrued as a freshman at St. Peter&#x27;s Prep, multiple schools have displayed intense interest in the stud defender. If not for a rough academic start, Nelson would undoubtedly be one of the most sought-after recruits in the northeast. He has put in the effort to turn things around academically, and he has been successful in doing so. Nelson now bolsters a 2.8 grade point average and is looking to continue to improve upon that even more so. &quot;My freshman year wasn&#x27;t the greatest, but I&#x27;m picking it up though. I have a tutor that I see three times a week,&quot; Nelson said. &quot;I also took extra classes last summer to improve my GPA, and it helped me out a lot. &quot;I&#x27;m more focused now, I know what&#x27;s on the table. Freshman year, I thought I was the man. I thought I was big, thought I was strong. I wasn&#x27;t focused. But now I know what I have to do, and I&#x27;m doing it to the best of my ability.&quot; Due to his improving academic performance, representatives from Michigan State, Miami (Fla.), Boston College, UConn, Miami, West Virginia, Pitt, Penn State and Georgia Tech have all been to DePaul Catholic to visit Nelson. &quot;I&#x27;m dealing with college coaches everyday whether it be through mail, on the phone or they come to my school,&quot; he said. Of all the schools recruiting him, Nelson believes that Rutgers, Maryland and Pitt are closest to offering, but he holds the possibility of attaining a Rutgers tender dearest to his heart. &quot;If Rutgers were to offer me, that would be the best feeling in the world. I&#x27;d go home and hug my father. I&#x27;d probably be in tears if I get an offer from Rutgers because all the hard work I&#x27;ve put in will have paid off,&quot; Nelson said. Nelson claims that Rutgers is his favorite school followed by Michigan State, Miami (Fla.) and Pitt, all of which have displayed serious interest. The Scarlet Knights are currently in the lead for his services due to the relationship Nelson has developed early on with the coaching staff. &quot;I really like the coaching staff,&quot; said Nelson. &quot;When I talk to them, they seem interested more in me as a person than as a player. They ask me how my family is doing and how I&#x27;m doing in school. &quot;They talk to me about football, but not as much as they talk about regular stuff and I really like that. And I feel like I can see myself there one day playing for those coaches. I really like the atmosphere at Rutgers and their games.

Although 5-11, 190-pound running back, <b>Donte Carter</b> - another senior - took home most of the accolades this season and led the team in most statistical categories, Herron is lightning-quick and was the most versatile play-maker that Hoboken possessed. Herron finished the championship game with 159 total offensive yards and a pick on defense. But it&#x27;s how he did it that made the performance special. The senior displayed tremendous speed and quick-twitch ability; the type that collegiate coaches covet. He could play at the FBS level if he gets an opportunity. Herron reminds me of Jaheem Woods of Neptune from last season. Carter is also talented and should wreak havoc on the FCS level. He&#x27;s a nice combination of power and speed. He&#x27;s not as natural with ability as Herron but puts forth more of a workman-like effort then explodes with a big play once he has lulled the defense to sleep.",

As Pittsburgh&#x27;s defensive coordinator from 2000-07, he was faced with three straight years of trying to figure out ways to slow former Rutgers star Ray Rice.

Rice capped that game-changing 90-yard drive — he rushed for 85 of the yards — with a one-yard touchdown run in the Knights&#x27; 20-10 victory. He finished with 225 rushing yards. &quot;The game was turning (in Pitt&#x27;s favor).

Because on that day, as an October snowfall turned the Rutgers campus into a white slippery mess, Eric LeGrand was freezing. &quot;I remember thinking about how cold it was,&quot; he recalled Tuesday, and this is the part most people won&#x27;t see when they pick up Sports Illustrated this week and look at the cover. LeGrand, the 21-year-old inspiration at the center of the photo, cannot regulate his body temperature because of his spinal-cord injury. He hates the cold. His mother fears it. His head coach worried that his motorized wheelchair might get stuck on the slush-covered field. And then what? But LeGrand was undeterred. He was leading his teammates — his friends — into that stadium, and nothing was going to stop him, including the condition that left him paralyzed below his shoulders. “This is my team. This is my senior year,” he said. “This chair wasn’t going to hold me back.” This is the image captured on the SI cover this week, under the headline “Best Moment of 2011.” LeGrand is wearing his No. 52 jersey, with two of his best friends, Scott Vallone and Khaseem Greene, walking at his side and resting their hands on his. They are all smiling. That fans chose this photo over 14 others, and with a half-million votes coming on Facebook from 178 countries, it makes the choice all the more powerful. From the moment LeGrand was injured in that awful collision with Army kick returner Malcolm Brown in October 2010, the Rutgers community has rallied around a single word. Believe. It began as a rallying cry that LeGrand would walk again, but in this instance, it takes on a different meaning. Maybe now, at the end of a horrifying year for college football, people want to believe the sport is about more than Jerry Sandusky and Penn State, more than the scandals that have ripped apart Miami, Ohio State and other big programs. • Former Rutgers football player Eric LeGrand continues progress, will stay with team for Pinstripe Bowl • Rutgers Football stories and columns<br/><br/> • Rutgers Football photos • Rutgers Football videos<br/> Is that a stretch? Not if you read the comments that fans posted on Facebook after they voted, with some writing that they spent hours trying to stuff the virtual ballot box. Not if you saw how the efforts to win this for LeGrand went viral on Twitter, with celebrities and NFL stars and politicians asking their followers to vote for No. 52, and vote often. “This is what sports are all about,” one user wrote. “Not the big superstars, rich millionaires, championship rings. No, it is the things that touch your heart and inspire people.” LeGrand was in a close race with David Freese, the World Series hero in St. Louis, in the first few days. Then a post on the FC Barcelona website vaulted its star, Lionel Messi, into first. Gov. Chris Christie and Newark Mayor Cory Booker got involved on the final day, eventually helping to push LeGrand over the top. The SI cover, despite the 24-7 ESPN-fueled culture in sports now, still stands as a time capsule. Bobby Hurley, the current Wagner assistant who was featured twice as a Duke star, put it this way Tuesday: “For that one week, you have to be part of something major, and you had to earn that honor.” LeGrand, who earned it with 14 months of rehab and recovery, was the last to find out Tuesday. He was at Rutgers to interview head coach Greg Schiano for a segment on SNY. The news was announced at noon, but when he asked his mother, Karen, for his iPhone to check the results, the woman who’s taken care of his every need since the injury ignored this one. “I left it in the car,” she lied. She wanted to join Schiano and present him with a poster-sized replica of the cover. LeGrand was told he finished with 29.3 percent of the votes, well ahead of second-place Messi (19.2 percent). He had topped an international soccer superstar, causing LeGrand to crack a wide smile. “I beat him out on this,” he said, “and now when I get better, I have to beat him out on the pitch.” LeGrand said he had more good news this week, that new muscles in his back are twitching as a result of his therapy on a treadmill, and that he sat upright with assistance for 35 seconds. “I have to get back on my feet, because that’s the main goal,” LeGrand said, “to show people if you believe in the man above and believe in yourself, to do anything that you want to do.”",

      "full": "The numbers weren’t pretty — some of them downright ghastly. Rutgers&#x27; running game this season lacked consistency and ran behind a revolving door of offensive linemen. Too often, it was just nonexistent. So was it a surprise for coach Greg Schiano that the Scarlet Knights ranked second to last in the nation in yards per carry? Not exactly. “It doesn’t surprise because we were 115th in the country in rushing, I think,” Schiano said, correctly running the ranking off the top of his head. “I don’t think we’ll be high in any stat rushing. “When you go minus-7 and minus-9 (yards rushing) in two different games, and yet we go 200 in some games. Hopefully that is the beginning — the seeds of growth — that we can do it some games, we can’t do it all the time. “And then our job is to do it all the time with consistency. That’s my hope.” So far his hopes haven’t come to fruition. The running game has struggled to find a groove.

And we came in and ran the ball for 200 yards on them. Come on. Syracuse was average and we didn’t run the ball. Every game is an independent event.” In fairness, the numbers weren’t as bad as they appeared for Rutgers. While the record shows they ran for 2.6 yards per attempt, strip away the sacks and lost yardage the NCAA includes in its rushing statistics and that goes up to a more respectable 3.3 yards per run. But peeling back the onion isn’t any more beneficial. The Knights still ranked 104th in the nation in runs of at least 10 yards or more (41) and 103rd in runs 20 yards or greater (eight). But at Yankee Stadium on Dec. 30, they’ll see a defense that was almost a mirror opposite. The Cyclones allowed 82 runs of 10-plus yards, 14th worst in the country. They allowed 4.6 yards per carry, 85th of all FBS teams. Still, Schiano says timing matters and Iowa State’s defense has improved in the second half of the season. “They’ve really played good defense in the latter part of the year,” the coach said. “That’s when we’re getting them. I wish we would have gotten them at the beginning of the year.” In their last four games of the season, Iowa State was still leaky — allowing 4.7 yards per carry against Kansas, Oklahoma State, Oklahoma and Kansas State.",

      "full": "NEW YORK — Nathaniel Hackett was making his way to the team hotel when he was stunned by the man standing in front of him, eager to greet all the coaches and their family members who’d ridden the Amtrak here from Syracuse. Rob Long, the team’s punter, was just days removed from an operation that found malignant cells in a tumor lifted from his brain. With a buzzed haircut, and a sharp, red scar striping the right half of his scalp, he simply flashed the wide, gap-toothed grin Hackett had become so accustomed to. “You just don’t know what to do in those situations,” said Hackett, the team’s quarterbacks coach. “Do I hug him? Do I smack him on his (butt)? Do I give him a high-five? It’s like, you just want to give him all your strength, and I think everything he does is amazing.” For the past four years, Long had been a symbol of consistency for a program that wasn’t. Through losing seasons, waning attendance and program overhaul, the senior from Downingtown, Pa., with the firecracker leg punted his way to two all-conference selections. He’s been a team captain the past two years. But as the payoff came, and the Orange was nearing their first postseason berth in six years, minute health problems began to snowball for the otherwise healthy 22-year-old. In early December, doctors found what they believed to be a benign tumor after an MRI. <br/> A few weeks later, it became apparent that things were much worse. For those who knew him, though, there was little doubt he’d be standing on the sidelines to watch his team take on Kansas State this afternoon at Yankee Stadium just a short time before he begins two rounds of chemotherapy. Smiling, as always. “There’s really no place I’d rather be,” Long said Tuesday. “Physically, I think I feel pretty good given the brain surgery two weeks ago. Emotionally, it’s been a roller coaster for the last month. Every day is a special day now.” The date and time aren’t hard to recall. At 7 p.m. Dec. 2, Long was sitting with his family when the doctors said he’d need to see a specialist as soon as possible. It was just hours after Rob’s mother, Mary Jo, found out that her sister was diagnosed with breast cancer. “It was like your world came crashing down,” Long said. Throughout the season, Long said he wasn’t feeling great, but didn’t think anything was awry until he began waking up and getting sick first thing in the morning. Now he had an explanation for the constant pain and chronic headaches. There was a reason his punts had lost velocity and distance, despite no dip in training or lifting.",

It was an opportunity for Rutgers (8-2) to notch a victory over a ranked opponent and pad its resume. Today, another opportunity arises when the Scarlet Knights host unbeaten Georgia, No. 16 in the country. It is a team with a familiar profile for Stringer.

That Rutgers will have only played two ranked teams by the end of December seems irregular. Last year they had played three. Three years ago they had played five, included at third-ranked Stanford in the second game of the season. It is a strategic decision by Stringer. She is coaching a team with no seniors on the roster and only one junior in the starting lineup.

Senior sharpshooting forward April Sykes paced the Scarlet Knights last night with a season-high 19 points as they shot a sizzling 65.5 percent in the first half to build an 18-point lead. Guard Khadijah Rushdan added 16 points and seven assists and center Monique Oliver had 15 points and seven rebounds.

      "full": "Disregard their friendship, C. Vivian Stringer suggested, and look at it dispassionately for a moment. Fine. If she can take her feelings out of this, just to make this point, the least we can do is follow the premise. She said if you keep your eye on the magisterial lady in the blazer with her arms folded tonight at the RAC, you won’t miss it: To watch Pat Summitt now, Stringer says, is to witness a seminal act of courage. The Rutgers coach knows what we are all thinking about her Tennessee counterpart and professional touchstone: We fear that Summit will suffer the worst of fates — that she&#x27;ll fade away by inches, and in public. Perhaps the process has already begun. Either way, only the bravest of people can do what she&#x27;ll do when the Knights host the Lady Vols, showing up to work when most of us — if it were within our means — would instead find some villa on an island somewhere to avoid becoming … what, a spectacle? No, an example, Stringer explained. And that’s the thing: Summitt willfully has chosen to be a symbol. The world has never had one for early-onset Alzheimer’s — a disease that strikes millions annually — and who is better suited for this task than one of the greatest leaders the sports world has ever created? “Because ask yourself this,” Stringer said. “What would your natural inclination be if you were in her shoes?” Probably to walk away, we replied. Give in to the impulse for solitude, with a side helping of self-pity. Certainly not to continue coaching, which requires about 120 to 150 fast decisions every game — in public. Why subject yourself to that? “Exactly,” Stringer said. “Now can you appreciate why she’s doing this? Can you imagine the courage this takes? The biggest problem some people have is they rise so high they can never suppress their ego, or can’t stand to be seen in a moment of weakness. Then they spend half their time watching everyone try to knock them down. “But if you never let your ego get away, we call that being grounded. Your head is in the game, attuned to things that really matter. You never lose sight of what’s important. Basketball is what we do, but Pat has never lost what she is. That’s the lesson in all this.” • • • They have nothing in common, and they have everything in common. Their back stories you know by now: One is the farm girl from Tennessee who found better competition against her brothers than in those archaic six-on-six games they played in Tennessee high schools. The other is from an Appalachian coal-mining town in western Pennsylvania, where girls basketball didn’t even make the radar, so she had to settle for being a cheerleader. Both had extremely strong role models. In Summitt’s case, it was her father, the austere and aloof Richard Head, whose authoritarian manner was followed to the letter until his daughter realized it could be tempered with compassion. In Stringer’s case, it was the formidable John Chaney, who had patented the coaching death stare his female counterparts perfected — helping Stringer develop an uncommon strength that overcame cancer and the loss of her husband, and gave her the ability to raise three kids on her own. The two women were both there at the dawn of Title IX. They were both head coaches by the time they were 23. They were both in the first women’s NCAA Final Four, in 1982, with Stringer somehow guiding Division 2 Cheyney State all the way to the championship game against Louisiana Tech. Among all women’s basketball coaches, they rank first and third in all-time victories. And they’ve always been there for each other, when necessary — and almost always for the cause of advancing the sport they pioneered. “We’ve always had dialogue over the years, and we both felt comfortable just picking up the phone when we noticed the other’s team wasn’t doing well,” Stringer said. They served on numerous committees together. They invented the SEC-Big Ten challenges. They had countless conversations about the big picture — where the game had to go, how to nurture and promote it. Over nearly four decades, they’ve taken it out of the stone age and delivered it to a global audience. “We were never very far apart, Pat and I,” Stringer said. “We knew then — as we do now — that we had the responsibility to grow the game. We’re both proud we were there first. And Pat always understood that it’s not about wins and losses, but that young women get the opportunity that their predecessors didn’t.” • • • Now Summitt is in the toughest fight of her life. Some 5.4 million Americans suffer from Alzheimer’s, nearly two-thirds of them women. And early-onset victims usually have no more than 10 years from diagnosis to death. So it’s unclear how much longer Summitt will want to continue coaching. The Lady Vols are just a few games into the season, but it’s already clear that the assistants have taken over the primary responsibilities — Holly Warlick runs the huddle and the post-game media responsibilities, while Mickie DeMoss and Dean Lockwood generally plot the offense and defense. But while Summitt says she doesn’t want this season to be about her Alzheimer’s, it’s a part of almost every move the program makes now. So be it: As athletic director Joan Cronin put it in Sports Illustrated recently, “We’re in uncharted waters. But if you were in uncharted waters, wouldn’t you want Pat to be your captain?” We can think of one rival who agrees. “She’s been a source of inspiration and pride and example of professionalism at the highest level for all of us, and she does things the right way,” Stringer said. “I mean, some of my greatest heartbreaks have come against Tennessee. But she’s someone I admire and respect. I really love her.” And now Summitt comes to Jersey, perhaps for the last time. If you’re lucky enough to get a seat, you’ll remember this night for the rest of your life, and it will have nothing to do with basketball. It will be about one indomitable lady’s trademark defiance. Her courage.",

But the second-half domination only served to underscore what Rice will be trying to figure out for the next six days: Which team is the real Rutgers? Is it the one that played with little emotion for the first 22-plus minutes of the night? Or is it the one that seized the final 17 minutes? “We’re an inconsistent team and that’s unfortunate,” Rice said afterward. “That’s who we are right now. There’s an immaturity to this team, still. There is things that we’re improving. There is progress. But right now, it’s not consistent enough for my liking and for successful basketball in the Big East. Our instincts are improving, but guys can’t pick and choose when they have passion and toughness.” That is the main obstacle the Scarlet Knights (7-5) haven’t been able to figure out through their nonconference schedule.

He remains committed to the Scarlet Knights, though, and now expects to sign during the traditional signing period in February, he told NJ Advance Media’s Todderick Hunt. Wise was not expected to sign early, so it’s not a surprise. But it is noteworthy given there was some buzz he would be an early signee in the days leading into National Signing Day. Wise is one of the more intriguing recruits projected to be in this Rutgers signing class. The Scarlet Knights initially recruited him as a quarterback and are expected to keep him there, at least to start, when he arrives on campus. But Wise also played some receiver at Barringer and could be an impact player there as well. Whenever Wise signs, he is not expected to enroll at Rutgers until the summer. That makes it likely he will redshirt in 2019. Cole Snyder, the other quarterback in this class, did sign Wednesday and will likely enroll in January. At this point, Snyder is the early favorite to be Rutgers&#x27; backup quarterback next season behind incumbent starter Artur Sitkowski. Sitkowski and Snyder are expected to be the only scholarship quarterbacks on the roster following Jalen Chatman’s recent transfer to Portland State and Johnathan Lewis&#x27; anticipated transition to becoming a full-time tight end. <i>James Kratch may be reached at </i><i>jkratch@njadvancemedia.com</i><i>.

I don&#x27;t know if anyone&#x27;s done that. &quot;Just amazing how important this playoff is and how the whole world revolves around it. I hope we get a shot.&#x27;&#x27; The Buckeyes won&#x27;t. Meyer found out Sunday that his Ohio State team was stiff-armed in its quest to earn a berth for the third time in the four years that the four-team College Football Playoff has been in existence. While ACC-champion Clemson, Big 12-champion Oklahoma and SEC-champion Georgia were virtual locks following their respective conference-championship wins Saturday, Ohio State was in in a discussion with Alabama. The Crimson Tide were No. 1 in every major poll for most of the season, but they were upset by Auburn two weeks ago. By not claiming the SEC West Division title, Alabama was idle on conference-championship Saturday. The complete College Football Playoff rankings are: 1. Clemson, 2. Oklahoma, 3. Georgia, 4.

      "full": "<b>By Ryan Dunleavy | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com</b> Here is the good news for coach Chris Ash: Rutgers has 18 returning starters expected back in 2018. Here is the news the newly extended Ash prefers to hear: Not all of those starting jobs are safe. Thanks to recruiting and the long-term benefit of playing young players earlier than expected to make up for injuries and a lack of depth, Rutgers finally has the intra-roster competition that Ash wanted to create. <i>RVision</i> For example, Rutgers only starts four defensive backs, but there could be as many as seven who have started in their careers. At linebacker and along the offensive line, veterans need to be wary of highly regarded rising sophomores who played sparingly in 2017 but might soon be coming into their own. And so on. &quot;It&#x27;s going to be a good team,&quot; linebacker Deonte Roberts said. &quot;We&#x27;ve got a lot of guys coming back. Sky is the limit. We&#x27;ve just got to get to work.&quot; Added safety Kiy Hester, &quot;I would say we took a medium (step forward in 2017). We are still not where we need to be, We still have to close the gap. We&#x27;re on the rise and going in the direction we need to go to.&quot; Here are NJ Advance Media&#x27;s way-too-early projections for the 2018 starters. Committed (but unsigned) 2018 recruits are included when appropriate, but any possible incoming transfers are not.<br/> <i>John Munson | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com</i> <b>CORNERBACK</b> Starters: Blessaun Austin, Isaiah Wharton Next up: Damon Hayes, Tre Avery Rutgers claimed it had three starters before last season, but, assuming Austin returns rather than going to the NFL, it really will have three next season because Hayes moved up to start the final eight games after Austin suffered a torn ACL. Wharton is the durable one of the group, starting all 36 games of his career. There won&#x27;t be many teams in the country with three more experienced cornerbacks. The problem in 2017 was finding a No. 4. Former Ohio State commit Tre Avery fits the bill after sitting out the season as an Akron transfer. <i>Dennis Schneidler | USA TODAY Sports</i> <b>SAFETY &nbsp</b> Starters: Saquan Hampton, K.J. Gray Next up: Kiy Hester, Edwin Lopez, Naijee Jones, Jawuan Harris It&#x27;s a similar situation to cornerback at safety, where Hester, Hampton and Gray all are experienced starters and all are injury-prone. If Rutgers can avoid overlapping injuries within the trio -- not as easy as it sounds, as shown over the last two seasons -- then it will have two starters and can break in two redshirt freshmen as backups. Gray and Hester have the ability to play free safety and strong safety, which is helpful. Has Harris played his last football game at Rutgers? Depends on if he gets picked in the MLB First-Year Player Draft and decides to pursue a minor-league baseball career. <i>Jeff Zelevansky</i> <b>LINEBACKER </b> Starters: MLB Deonte Roberts, WLB Tyshon Fogg, SLB Tyreek Maddox-Williams Next up: WLB Trevor Morris, MLB Brendan DeVera, SLB Olakunle Fatukasi, SLB Syhiem Simmons Wait a second. There&#x27;s linebacker depth? The position that was a &quot;mess&quot; during Ash&#x27;s first spring practice suddenly is the epitome of a position where returning starters will have to fight to keep their jobs. There&#x27;s a chance that Rutgers could go with the same trio that finished the 2016 season -- Roberts, Morris and Maddox-Williams, who will be returning for a season-long ACL tear. But Fogg came on strong at the end of the season and will challenge Morris, a Honorable Mention All-Big Ten selection. Strong side linebacker might be the most important position in Ash&#x27;s defense when functioning correctly, and it has been a two-year revolving door. Fatukasi and Simmons (a redshirt) will nip at Maddox-Williams&#x27; heels in the search for stability. <b>Rutgers football coaches on the recruiting trail</b> See photos of who they&#x27;ve met with <i>Noah K. Murray | USA TODAY Sports</i> <b>DEFENSIVE LINE</b> Starters: DE Elorm Lumor, DE Kevin Wilkins, DT Jon Bateky, DT Will Previlon Next up: DT Jaohne Duggan, DT Julius Turner, DE Mike Tverdov, DE Tijuan Mason, DE CJ Onyechi. Wilkins, in his first season as an end, and Previlon took big steps forward in 2017, and Bateky took a small one after missing time with a high ankle sprain. Turner finished an up-and-down season by getting thrown off the field by Ash in the last game of the season. Onyechi and Lumor step into the &quot;Jack&quot; position -- stand-up edge-rusher -- vacated by Kemoko Turay. Duggan traveled every game this season despite not playing -- a sign that Rutgers is prepping him to play a big role in 2018. Tverdov and Mason must know everything about each other at this point after spending every fall practice walking side-by-side to stay active while injured. Junior college transfers can be hit or miss, but this is a spot where Rutgers the risk-reward makes sense. <i>Andrew Mills | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com</i> <b>OFFENSIVE LINE</b> Starters: LT Tariq Cole, LG Jonah Jackson, C Mike Maietti, RG Micah Clark, RT Kamaal Seymour Next up: OG Nick Krimin, OG Marcus Applefield, OT Sam Vretman, OT Mike Lonsdorf Will Cole forego his final year of eligibility or return as a third-year starter? If he does the latter to cut down on his penalties -- that&#x27;s the prediction here -- then there is only one starter to replace (left guard Dorian Miller) unless Marcus Applefield pursues a graduate transfer. Backup Zach Heeman has the same option available. One starter is waiting in the wings as Jackson and Maietti shared time at center and one can move to guard. But Rutgers played Clark and Vretman as true freshmen backups rather than sticking sticking them on the scout team. Clark, the highest-rated recruit in the state in 2017, could supplant returning starter Seymour the way Seymour once a veteran supplanted J.J. Denman. It&#x27;s time for Rutgers to benefit from coach A.J. Blazek&#x27;s shrewd two-year strategy of rolling in backups to create depth. <b>By the numbers: A look at Rutgers passing game</b> Comparing 2016 to 2017 <i>Abby Drey | TNS</i> <b>TIGHT END </b> Starter: Jerome Washington Next up: Nakia Griffin-Stewart, Travis Vokolek Washington hasn&#x27;t ruled out the NFL, but he likely will be advised that one productive college season isn&#x27;t enough to test the waters. He led Rutgers in receptions -- including a couple crazy catches -- but needs to establish himself as more of a red-zone threat. Griffin-Stewart also flashed good hands, but the coaching staff is high on Vokolek, which led to burning his redshirt midway through the season. <i>Andrew Mills | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com</i> <b>RUNNING BACK &nbsp </b> Starter: Raheem Blackshear Next up: Trey Sneed, Elijah Barnwell, Stevie Scott, Isaih Pacheco As linebacker has gained experience, running back has gone in the opposite direction, with the losses of Gus Edwards, Robert Martin and Josh Hicks. The 5-foot-9, 185-pound Blackshear has the most experience -- he scored five touchdowns on 46 touches from scrimmage as a true freshman -- but is he big enough and mature enough to withstand the pounding on a No. 1 back in the Big Ten? Sneed, who had 16 carries in 2016, comes off a mid-career redshirt, Barnwell comes off a torn ACL that kept him out of practice, and Scott and Pacheco will look to be the next true freshmen contributors. <b>Closer look at Rutgers freshmen in 2017</b> Results for 14 who played, and who redshirted? <i>Chris Faytok | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com</i> <b>WIDE RECEIVER</b> Starters: Bo Melton, Shameen Jones, Hunter Hayek Next up: Everett Wormley, Mohamed Jabbie, Dacoven Bailey, Tyler Hayek It&#x27;s easy enough to just plug in the rising sophomores -- Hayek, Melton and Wormley -- who combined to make nine starts. Or even rising redshirt sophomore Jabbie, who made six starts. But Jones had a strong first season on the scout team and will challenge his classmates. Either way, it&#x27;s a rotation position that needs much better results after the receivers went 11 straight games without a touchdown catch and had multiple games of 0-2 combined catches. Don&#x27;t rule out a graduate transfer if an extra scholarship emerges. <i>Andrew Mills | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com</i> <b>QUARTERBACK &nbsp</b> Starter: Johnathan Lewis Next up: Giovanni Rescigno, Artur Sitkowski, Tom Flacco, Jalen Chatman This is the most important position on the team -- and the one with the least clarity. The only safe bet is that Rutgers -- which has played seven quarterbacks and started three over the last two years -- will play multiple quarterbacks and probably start multiple, too. It could be Rescigno, who has 12 career starts -- as long as he doesn&#x27;t graduate transfer. Before the season finale, he told NJ Advance Media he planned to stay at Rutgers. It could be Lewis, who was feast or famine as a true freshman playing in seven games off the bench. Or it could be Sitkowski or Chatman as long as both sign their letters of intent and enroll in January -- a huge advantage for a quarterback -- as expected. It&#x27;s likely one will be on the two-deep and the other will redshirt to break up the eligibility classes.",

He will be a free agent in the offseason. <b>CB Marcus Cooper, Chicago Bears</b> Cooper has started four games and has 17 tackles and three passes defended, but his viral moment of the season was when he cost the Bears an easy touchdown with a bonehead play when he stopped short of the end zone at the 3-yard line after a long field goal return and the ball was stripped away. That won&#x27;t make him a fan favorite. <b>LS Andrew DePaola, Chicago Bears</b> DePaola was released by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers at the end of training camp but caught on with the Bears and has long snapped in all 13 games. <b>LB Jonathan Freeny, New England Patriots</b> After spending the 2015 and 2016 seasons with the Patriots, Freeny was a victim of the final round of preseason cuts.

Apparently, he is qualified for the FBS level of play and ready to contribute on the banks, after making public on signing day 2017 that he&#x27;d eventually become a Scarlet Knight. And it appears that his time at Milford has done him some good, and in a number of areas. &quot;I improved everything,&quot; Lewis told NJ.com. &quot;I just became a better player at Milford. It made me more mature as a player and and person.&quot; In 2017, Lewis caught 41 passes for 1,072 yards, 15 TDs and a 26.1 yard per catch average for a 10-2 team.

Under Jerry Kill this season, Rutgers employed a run-heavy attack in multiple sets and — despite an anemic passing attack — the Scarlet Knights’ offense was good enough in Big Ten wins over Illinois, Purdue and Maryland. Still, raise your hand if you know exactly what Rutgers’ offensive identity is heading into Year 3 under Ash. Last season, Rutgers’ run-first approach made sense considering the offensive strength was a deep running back corps. But with the team’s top two rushers — Gus Edwards and Robert Martin — both graduated, the tailback spot is about as big of a question mark as a quarterback position that will feature a wide-open competition. Whoever takes the job will have a blank slate to work with. <b>Decide the QB pecking order</b>",

Joe Hermitt | jhermitt@pennlive.com ORLANDO, FLA. – Penn State is now just three days away from its New Year&#x27;s Day matchup with Kentucky. The team has experienced a Best Buy shopping spree, spent some time enjoying the Universal Studios amusement park, and of course have held team practices and meetings along the way as the players, staff, and their families enjoy sunny weather leading up to game day. “It’s been a fantastic start to the week,” offensive coordinator Ricky Rahne said. “The hospitality has been great; the coaches and players and families have enjoyed it. Our practice facility has worked really well for us. It’s a reward, and to come to Orlando and have such great hosts and have a great opponent in Kentucky.” Find our key takeaways from Saturday’s hour-long media session below. <b>Key to the game for Kentucky&#x27;s offense</b> The Wildcats come into this matchup at 9-3, just like Penn State. And, much like the Lions, the SEC school has used strong defensive performances and a sound running game to get by. There is no question that the Lions have the quarterback edge, as Trace McSorley will play the final game of his illustrious career in blue and white opposite Kentucky signal caller Terry Wilson Jr., but this one will be won in the trenches, and offensive coordinator Eddie Gran is aware of which PSU unit his team must neutralize. “Their front is how they operate,” Gran said. “They’re the real deal. The front makes them go. Those front four guys are really good, and they have some backups come in who are really productive.” That said, the third-year Kentucky staffer also realizes that his team must deal with more than just a Lions pass rush that has the most sacks in the Big Ten. “Amani [Oruwariye] I think is a heck of a player, Micah Parsons, he’s productive as heck, and he’s a guy that just shows up, and Coach [Brent] Pry does a great job,” Gran added. “They’re fundamentally sound. We’re going to have to deal with the front. They’re real.” Penn State cornerback Amani Oruwariye carries the American flag before the Iowa game on Oct. 27, 2018. Joe Hermitt | jhermitt@pennlive.com <b>Wildcats dialed in on McSorley</b> A month off before the bowl game certainly allowed Trace McSorley to get healthy. It also gave the Wildcats plenty of time to game plan for No. 9. What are they most worried about? “When he starts to scramble, he can throw the ball effectively down the field,” star Kentucky end/linebacker Josh Allen said. “He knows how to get out of the pocket. We have to do a good job containing the rush and get home.” Penn State quarterback Trace McSorley answers a question during a Citrus Bowl press conference on Dec. 29, 2018. Joe Hermitt | jhermitt@pennlive.com Added defensive coordinator Matt House: “A winner. A guy that just consistently finds a way to win. He prolongs downs, he can throw the ball vertically down the field, he can hurt you with his feet, but more than anything, I think he’s just a winner.” There&#x27;s no arguing that, as McSorley will start his 40<sup>th</sup> career game in the Citrus Bowl and can win his 32<sup>nd</sup> contest in blue and white with a victory on Tuesday. His first passing attempt will also make him the first quarterback in Penn State history to throw a pass in four bowl games. “It’s been an honor to coach a kid who gives everything he’s got every day,” Penn State offensive coordinator Ricky Rahne said. “Whether you’re in March and your meeting, or whether it’s preseason practice and a 7v7 drill, whatever it is, he’s giving his maximum effort and attention to detail. That’s a rare thing.” <b>What worries Penn State about Kentucky?</b> Regardless of whether you’ve been consuming every drivel of Penn State news leading up to the bowl game or are just getting back into the swing of things following the holidays, you’ve still probably heard about both of Kentucky’s stars: End/linebacker Josh Allen and running back Benny Snell. Allen, a senior, is a future first-round NFL draft pick and the definition of a game wrecker no matter where he lines up. Snell, who is a junior, has already declared for the NFL Draft but will still play in the contest. How does Penn State size up both potential game changers? <b>On Allen:</b> “I would say that obviously he’s an extremely effective pass rusher, which the stats will tell you that,” PSU offensive coordinator Ricky Rahne said. “It’s because of his first step. He has great acceleration off the ball. He also uses his hands really well, and that’s what sets him apart. “That’s the thing that is going to make him a great player at the next level. I’ve coached against Von Miller and some of those guys, and he’s right up there. Has great length, probably better strength then people give him credit for, and his coaches put him in a great place to be successful.” “You definitely have to have an awareness of where he’s at,” quarterback Trace McSorley added. “He’s able to pin his ears back. You have to have an awareness of a guy like him. He’s extremely good at getting in and getting strip sacks and attacking the ball.” Junior running back Benny Snell Jr. poses at Kentucky NCAA college football media day at Kroger field in Lexington, Ky., Friday Aug 3, 2018. (Silas Walker/Lexington Herald-Leader via AP) <b>On Snell:</b> “He’s obviously a quality back, and we’ve seen our fair share of those, but he’s very patient, runs physical; over the course of a game, like a lot of backs they get better, but he wears on your defense,” PSU DC Brent Pry said. “You see guys not defending him as well late in games, so we know it’s going to be a four-quarter battle with him. It’s going to take a united effort to slow him down.” <b>Best Buy shopping highlights</b> When bowl season arrives, one often talked about benefit is extra practices, both for young players and overall team development. Another boon are the gifts that the players and staff receive from sponsors of the game as well as the bowl committee. For Penn State and Kentucky players, one of their gifts was a $400 Best Buy gift card, which they were able to use during an event at a Florida-area store earlier this week. From left, Penn State offensive coordinator Ricky Rahne, defensive coordinator Brent Pry, safety Nick Scott and quarterback Trace McSorley head out after a Citrus Bowl press conference on Dec. 29, 2018. Joe Hermitt | jhermitt@pennlive.com What did some of the players walk out with? “Best Buy, couple guys were buying crock pots,” McSorley said with a smile. “[John Petrishen] was walking out with the vacuum robot.” As for McSorley’s choices? “I got an Apple Watch and a gaming headset for my Xbox,” he said. The team also spent some time at the aforementioned Universal Studios. “I like amusement parks,” McSorley said. “I’m still a little kid. Being there was fun.” <b>What&#x27;s up with Tommy Stevens?</b> We’ll temporarily close our coverage in the Sunshine State before the team has practice later Saturday with a note on backup quarterback Tommy Stevens. The redshirt junior did not travel with the team here due to an undisclosed surgical procedure, but he is expected to be back for spring practice in the new year. How has he grown through all the challenges of 2018, which included at least two separate stints in a walking boot? “It’s been probably a lot of ups-and-downs for him, but he’s had a great mentality throughout it all,” McSorley said. “He did everything he could at practice to get the team better, even when he wasn’t participating. “He’s been doing everything he can to make the team better, and he’s had a really good attitude about it. This is one of the things I think will make him better. He’s had to grow as a player without being on the field as much as he would have liked, and I’m excited about what he’s going to become.” Penn State quarterback Tommy Stevens looks downfield during the second quarter on Nov. 10, 2018.

Four-star running back Noah Cain has lived in Louisiana and Texas and has played high school football in the Longhorn State and also at IMG Academy in Florida. Will a stop in Pennsylvania be added to his future list of residences and playing destinations? Cain picks between Auburn, Georgia, Tennessee, Texas, and the Lions in the 11 a.m. hour, which is a key detail as ESPN2 is slated to carry four commitment ceremonies between 11 and Noon. Cain will announce his choice in Texas and enroll at the school of his choice in January. The 247Sports&#x27; Crystal Ball prediction feature currently favors the Lions landing Cain, which would mark their second back in the class as Virginia four-star Devyn Ford is already set to sign Wednesday, but there is enough movement for Texas and LSU to think that this one is still a bit up in the air just hours before the back&#x27;s choice becomes public. We’ll update this post with firmer details if and when Cain and/or ESPN shares the announcement’s timing. This is always a fun, but completely meaningless, part of the Signing Day festivities. Two years ago, quarterback Sean Clifford was the first prospect on the board at 7:30 a.m. Last year, end Nick Tarburton led things off at 7:33 a.m. In this year’s total dart throw, we’ll set the over/under for the first announcement at 7:31 a.m. and predict that it will be four-star New Jersey quarterback Ta’Quan Roberson.

USA Today’s Dan Wolken reported Monday night that former five-star quarterback and onetime Penn State commit Justin Fields ‘has informed’ Georgia that he intends to transfer out of the Bulldogs’ program. Neither the school or player have commented on the news, but if Fields does leave before or after UGA’s Sugar Bowl showdown with Texas, he would become perhaps the biggest transfer target in the history of the sport. In today’s notes package, we ponder whether or not Fields could end up back with the Lions, discuss their chances with a three-star from New Jersey who put them in his top-four, and look at the latest recruiting nuggets as the fax machines in college football buildings across the country get tuned up for Wednesday’s festivities. <b>Dissecting Smith Vilbert&#x27;s top-four</b> St. Joe defensive Smith Vilbert chases after SPP quarterback Maasai Maynor as St. Joseph Regional beats St. Peter&#x27;s Prep 16-7 in football action. 10/27/18 Montvale, NJ John Munson | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com Every recruiting cycle brings new names to know for Penn State as Signing Day nears.

Smith Vilbert, a three-star defensive end from New Jersey, was not a name being listed as a top Lions target for much of the fall, but he popped onto the radar when James Franklin’s program extended an offer on Nov. 2. A number of other schools quickly followed suit, and Vilbert visited Penn State in December to get a better feel for things in State College. Then, he was considering all of his options. Now, he’s down to four schools: The Lions, Oregon, Florida, and Syracuse. What are the teams fighting for? “Long, big frame with wide shoulders. Is 6-6, 250 and can play at 270 on the edge. Length is impressive and he uses it well,” 247Sports writes in an evaluation. “Improved technique is a must. Needs to learn to use combo moves. Increasing ability to bend at knees will help with leverage at point of attack and against run. Lacks experience. Has to improve lower body strength. Two- to three- year starter at strong Power 5 program and mid-level NFL draft pick.” Put another way, Vilbert has a lot of upside but needs to be developed.

      "full": "<b>Orlando, Fla. -- </b>Penn State signed a highly-touted recruiting Class of 2018, and that group quickly made an impact on the field, especially on defense and special teams. Harrisburg product and linebacker Micah Parsons led the team with 69 tackles despite starting just one game, and a position mate, Jesse Luketa, netted seven tackles and played a lot on the kick coverage units over the team’s first 12 games of the season. Beyond those two, end Jayson Oweh showed signs of promise, as he made four tackles and recorded two sacks in four games, while defensive tackle PJ Mustipher made 14 tackles and added a sack. First-year corner Trent Gordon also hit the stat sheet with a few tackles while playing mostly special teams this season, as well. How can the group continue to earn more playing time during and beyond Tuesday’s Citrus Bowl matchup opposite Kentucky at Camping World Stadium? “There’s a certain standard that we have, and Nick [Scott] understands that very well,” Pry said Saturday during Citrus Bowl media day. &quot;Maturity, and the way you approach the game, is really important to me and our defensive staff, and I think that there’s expectations that these guys have and you’re not just going to come in and be a one dimensional guy. “You’re going to have to be at least working toward being a complete player. That’s meetings, that’s practice habits, that’s all of that.” The response might help explain why Parsons continues to run with the second-team in practice behind starter Koa Farmer, even if he began to significantly out snap the senior during the second half of the season. “For those freshmen, that’s an eye opener,” Pry continued. &quot;To be good at this level, we got some other things we want to be good at outside of running to the ball and making plays. “Our preparation is very important to me and our defensive staff and the leaders of our unit. There’s work to be done in those areas with all those new guys.” The work continues next week and then starts a new, as the team will begin prepping for the 2019 season in early January.

Joe Hermitt | jhermitt@pennlive.com Believe it or not, Penn State only had one defensive line commitment in its Class of 2019, from Virginia four-star Hakeem Beamon, before Monday. Now, that count stands at two, as longtime top target Adisa Isaac finally jumped on board. The Brooklyn, N.Y., four-star and 6-foot-5, 220-pound recruit picked the Lions over Miami, and 28 other programs were also involved at one point or another. Penn State was on him early and made him a priority from the start, and in the recruiting game, that can mean as much as anything else, even when facilities, academic opportunities, future outlook, and other details are factored in. What is Penn State getting? “Uber athletic with great length. Is 6-5, 220, but has frame to carry 240 pounds easily. Is dominant off the edge,” a 247Sports evaluation says. “Great burst, body control and closing speed. Long strides at get-off allows him to get around edge in three steps. “Overall technique improvement needed. Can be a dominant player at an elite Power 5 program with first-round NFL draft pick potential.” It’s high praise, and deservingly so for the nation’s No. 4 defensive end and the No. 61 player nationally according to the 247Sports’ Composite rankings. But, as you can tell from reading the evaluation, he’s not a ready-made package. Not yet, anyway, but a few months in Dwight Galt’s strength and conditioning program and some fine-tuning with Sean Spencer and co. can go a long way in changing that. It’s a major boon that he will enroll in January, as well. Ultimately, Isaac has the potential to be a first-year contributor, but like Micah Parsons, he will need to work his way into it, and a progression like Jayson Oweh’s is a good expectation level. Like Isaac, Oweh came in with tons of potential but needed to refine his game and bulk up. He did that and ended up making a few splash plays in 2018 while setting the table for a breakout year in 2019. Isaac should aim to follow a similar path. <b>The latest recruiting updates</b> Penn State head coach James Franklin during practice at Holuba Hall on Dec. 14, 2018. Joe Hermitt | jhermitt@pennlive.com As noted above, Penn State went one-for-two with Monday’s announcements, as four-star Isaac picked the Lions while Nokesville, Va., three-star offensive lineman Jakai Moore selected South Carolina over James Franklin’s program. What now? There are no decisions involving the Lions currently scheduled for Tuesday, but as history has taught us, surprises this time of year are a dime a dozen, so always stay tuned for the latest.",

Head coach James Franklin already has commitments from four-star New Jersey guard Caedan Wallace, four-star Delaware guard Saleem Wormley, and Lackawanna Community College four-star tackle Anthony Whigan, but the program would like to add maybe one more offensive lineman, though the list of options is thin. One name to know is Doug Nester, as the four-star from West Virginia visited campus over the weekend despite being a longtime Ohio State commit. It appears now that the 6-foot-6, 315-pound tackle will wait until February to sign, which is bad news for the Buckeyes but good news for the Lions and others as they look to potentially flip him.",

Meyer was placed on administrative leave on Aug. 1. The Ohio State board of trustees suspended Meyer for the first three games of the season following an independent finding that Meyer did know of the allegations against Smith in 2015 and that he and athletic director Gene Smith were not in compliance with Title IX or university policy.

      "full": "BY GREG PICKEL | gpickel@pennlive.com Penn State head coach James Franklin meets the press during Citrus Bowl media day on Dec. 14, 2018. Joe Hermitt | jhermitt@pennlive.com STATE COLLEGE – The December National Signing Day will be held this Wednesday, and Penn State is aiming to capitalize. Head coach James Franklin’s program scored 21 National Letter of Intent signatures on that day a year ago, which was the first of its kind after the NCAA changed the recruiting rulebook to add an early signing period in addition to the traditional one, which is annually the first Wednesday of February and still in effect, although few prospects will wait to sign until then. &quot;I think the early signing period, for the most part, has done what it was intended to do,&quot; Franklin said on Friday. &quot;I think the feedback I&#x27;ve gotten from my staff, as well as our assistant coaches around the country, other head coaches around the country, really from high school coaches and prospects, I think it&#x27;s been pretty good.<br/><br/>&quot;It hasn&#x27;t played out a whole lot different than I think most people thought it would, which was this is going to become the signing day. I don&#x27;t know what the numbers are. If I had to guess, probably 85% or higher, probably as high as 95% that sign on the first signing day. The second signing allows you to maybe solve some problems.&quot; Penn State is still looking to fill some holes for this signing period, and it has a few outstanding targets with which it hopes to do so in the recruiting Class of 2019. The staff, including Franklin, has been on the road almost non-stop since the day after the Maryland win wrapped up the regular season, and it’s safe to say that they’ve left no stone unturned. In this special recruiting-themed installment of the PennLive Penn State Sunday situation, we break down everything you need to know to get ready for the week ahead. <b>The current PSU recruiting landscape</b> Penn State head coach James Franklin meets the press during Citrus Bowl media day on Dec. 14, 2018. Joe Hermitt | jhermitt@pennlive.com As of Sunday morning, Penn State has 16 verbal commitments in this recruiting class. They break down by position as follows: By state, the rundown looks like this: If you’re surprised by the wide variety of states represented, don’t be, because having a Mid-Atlantic and Pennsylvania focus with some national flavor mixed in has long been a part of the plan. &quot;It&#x27;s kind of the nature of the beast,&quot; Franklin said. &quot;One of the challenges for us is we&#x27;ve been predominantly a regional program when it comes to recruiting. As you guys know, I&#x27;ve kind of tried to expand that each year to be a little bit more national because there&#x27;s just going to be years where our region won&#x27;t support a certain position, and we better have the ability to be able to go a little bit further to get that done.<br/> <br/> &quot;I think that&#x27;s what you see in this class. You see a little bit of maybe some areas that we haven&#x27;t been as active in in the past. Hopefully that will open up some opportunities for us in the future, as well. Ja&#x27;Juan [Seider] obviously has been a big part of that [in Florida]. Our coaches all kind of recruit their position nationally. I think you see a little bit of that.&quot; According to 247Sports, nine of the expected signees (see the full list below) will be January enrollees, which means they will be able to get a jump start on the learning curve of playing college football while attending classes and living away from home. The class is headlined on defense by five-star linebacker Brandon Smith, from Mineral, Va., who is the nation’s No. 25 player according to the 247Sports’ Composite rankings. Guard Caedan Wallace, from Princeton, N.J., is the highest-rated player on offense at No. 71 nationally. It has just one player, Ft. Lauderdale, Fla., receiver John Dunmore, who might entertain other options before signing day, but otherwise, the class appears to be locked in, and it’s more likely than not that Dunmore, a longtime Lions commit, ultimately signs with them come Wednesday. As for the amount of space left, we peg it at about five to six, but there will need to be some additional roster deletion aside from safety Isaiah Humphries, who has announced his decision to transfer, and tackle Sterling Jenkins, who is done after this season despite having a year of eligibility left. Postseason roster attrition is common, though, which is how the handful of spots should open up if Penn State can find enough players to sign. One final note: A recruiting dead period is now in effect, which means coaches cannot visit recruits at their schools and prospects can no longer come to campus. That restriction ends in mid-January. <b>Decision to watch: Jakai Moore</b> Virginia offensive lineman Jakai Moore poses in Penn State and South Carolina gear. The senior will pick between the two schools on Monday. Photo courtesy Jakai Moore via Twitter. The first December Signing Day week decision involving Penn State, barring any surprises, will take place on Monday at 3:30 p.m. ET, which is when Nokesville, Va., three-star offensive lineman Jakai Moore will make his future destination known. A 6-foot-6, 295-pound senior, Moore could play tackle or guard at the next level based on how he fills out once he arrives at the school of his choice. He’s down to South Carolina and Penn State, and both schools had an in-home visit with the lineman and his family last week with hopes of making their case in a convincing fashion before he decides. &quot;He&#x27;s hearing very similar things from both South Carolina and Penn State in terms of the love and how he can fit in and potentially play early,&quot; Patriot High coach Brud Bicknell told The State newspaper last week. “All the good things and they are both making the final push.” In the modern age of recruiting, there are typically very few toss-up decisions or surprises. Moore bucks that trend, as the recruiting world seems uncertain of whether he’ll end up being a Lion or Gamecock. The 247Sports’ Crystal Ball prediction forecast currently leads slightly to Penn State, but this one figures to go down to the wire. <b>The pick: </b> If you would have taken a poll of recruiting insiders back in the spring, it’s likely that most would have predicted that Moore would have committed to the Lions by now. The fact that he hasn’t, then, is eyebrow-raising, but in the end, we’ll score this one for Penn State. <b>Decision to watch: Noah Cain</b> Penn State recruit Noah Cain visits for the Wisconsin game on Nov. 10, 2018. Joe Hermitt | jhermitt@pennlive.com From Saquon Barkley to Miles Sanders, Journey Brown, and Ricky Slade, Penn State has proven adept at finding star running backs and under the radar ones that could blossom into studs alike during the James Franklin era. What it hasn’t been able to do, however, is land two players that fit that mold in one cycle. The Lions are hoping to change that this year, however, as they got on the board with four-star Stafford, Va., ball carrier Devyn Ford, a top-100 player nationally, way back in May 2018. The program did not rest on its laurels, though, as it has continued to send out offers to try and woo another back in this cycle. After a few close calls, it appears that Noah Cain, a four-star from Bradenton, Fla., who ranks just ahead of Ford on the national scene, is their next best shot. The 5-foot-10, 210-pound prospect will reveal his choice on a national stage Wednesday morning, as he’ll pick between Georgia, Texas, Auburn, Tennessee, and the Lions during a live ESPN broadcast at 11:30 a.m. ET from his hometown of Denton, Tex. Penn State, after hosting him for an official visit in November, has plenty of reason to feel good about where it stands, and Cain hosted Franklin and co. for an in-home breakfast visit last week. The Vols are making a strong late push, however, and the other three programs are worthy foes in this one. <b>The pick: </b> The aforementioned Seider is an ace recruiter overall, but especially in the Sunshine State, and this would mark another major victory for the first-year coach there after he netted Dunmore earlier this year. None of the finalists would be a surprise pick, but the Lions have trended well enough in this one that they should win out in the end. <b>Who else is on the board?</b> Penn State recruit Adisa Isaac visits with James Franklin for the Whiteout against Ohio State on Sept. 29, 2018. Joe Hermitt | jhermitt@pennlive.com Moore and Cain have locked in their decision plans, but they are hardly the only two prospects left for the Lions to chase. That lengthy list, in no particular order, also includes: Penn State recruit D&#x27;Von Ellies visits for the Wisconsin game on Nov. 10, 2018. Joe Hermitt | jhermitt@pennlive.com The catch with all of them is that they have not yet made clear when they will announce their decision. Some of that group could announce on signing day, while others could wait until February. In a large way, it’s all a guessing game at this point. It’s likely, too, that some surprise names could pop up in the next few days, as the Lions have had a habit of landing recruits at the last minute that were hardly discussed before signing day if they were at all. Former defensive lineman Brennon Thrift comes to mind in that regard. Stay tuned for updates in the days to come, because the wild, wild west of college football recruiting is about to roll into town. <b>The current Class of 2019: </b> <b>Brandon Smith (January enrollee) </b> Position: Linebacker<br/> High School: Louisa County (Virginia)<br/> Height:  6-4              <br/> Weight: 228<br/> Recruiting rankings<br/> 247: 5 stars<br/> ESPN: 4 stars<br/> Rivals: 4 stars<br/> Others considered:<br/> Texas A&M, Auburn, Alabama, Clemson, and over 25 others. <b>Caedan Wallace</b> Position: Guard<br/> High School: Hun School (Virginia)<br/> Height: 6-5            <br/> Weight: 295 <br/> Recruiting rankings<br/> 247: 4 stars<br/> ESPN: 4 stars<br/> Rivals: 4 stars<br/> Others considered:<br/> Oklahoma, Auburn, California, Clemson, and over 25 others. <b>Devyn Ford</b> Position: Running back <br/> High School: North Stafford (Virginia) <br/> Height: 5-11<br/> Weight: 195 pounds<br/> Recruiting rankings<br/> 247: 4 stars<br/> ESPN: 4 stars<br/> Rivals: 5 stars<br/> Others considered:<br/> Virginia Tech, Clemson, Virginia and over 25 others. <b>John Dunmore</b> Position: Receiver<br/> High School: Chaminade-Madonna Prep (Florida) <br/> Height: 6-2              <br/> Weight: 172 pounds<br/> Recruiting rankings<br/> 247: 4 stars<br/> ESPN: 4 stars<br/> Rivals: 4 stars<br/> Others considered:<br/> Florida State, Miami, Florida, Michigan, and over 25 others. <b>Lance Dixon (January enrollee) </b> Position: Linebacker<br/> High School: West Bloomfield (Michigan)<br/> Height: 6-2<br/> Weight: 201 <br/> Recruiting rankings<br/> 247: 4 stars<br/> ESPN: 4 stars<br/> Rivals: 3 stars<br/> Others considered:<br/> Michigan State, Wisconsin, and over 20 others.

      "full": "For much of 2018, some place in Pennsylvania was at the center of the sports news world. At times, much of the state as a whole was. And when not, it was usually adjacent. Stories closer to the state itself than any national news caught occasionally caught our attention. And as we look back on a frankly overflowing year, we&#x27;re counting down the 10 biggest sports stories PennLive covered. Yes, Penn State, the Philadelphia Eagles and even the Pittsburgh Steelers, struggling as they may be at the moment, made the list. You&#x27;re quite welcome to stick around for the ride: (AP Photo/Julio Cortez) <b>10. Saquon Barkley takes the NFL by storm</b> (AP Photo/Carlos Osorio) After the New York Giants selected him with the second overall pick in the draft, the 21-year-old former Penn State star went on to rush for 1,198 yards from 244 carries and 10 touchdowns. He added 688 yards and four scores through the air from 87 catches. Going into Week 17 he is the third-leading rusher in the NFL. Barkley is already the first Giants running back to top 1,000 yards as a rookie. <b>9. Urban Meyer out</b> (AP Photo/Jay LaPrete) The Buckeyes head coach denied knowing of abuse allegations against his assistant coach, Zach Smith, despite Brett McMurphy reporting that Smith&#x27;s wife, Courtney and Shelley Meyer, the head coach&#x27;s wife, exchanged texts about Smith&#x27;s alleged domestic violence. Meyer was placed on administrative leave on Aug. 1. The Ohio State board of trustees suspended Meyer for the first three games of the season following an independent finding that Meyer did know of the allegations against Smith in 2015 and that he and athletic director Gene Smith were not in compliance with Title IX or university policy. On Dec. 4, Meyer announced he was retiring after the Rose Bowl due to concerns about his health. <b>8. Penn State goes to its own Rose Bowl</b> A nine-game winning streak ended in a shootout in Pasadena, ending a once national title-contending campaign with an 11-3 record. The Nittany Lions failed to build on the 2017 campaign as three Big Ten East losses to Ohio State, Michigan State and Michigan, respectively, sent them to the Citrus Bowl and a New Year&#x27;s Day matchup with No. 16 Kentucky. <b>7. Running the richest and poorest football programs in the Big Ten, NCAA</b> Rutgers is the poorest in the conference, taking in $25.4 million while Michigan raked in $105.9 million in the previous fiscal year. Penn State fell in between, albeit on the higher end of the spectrum. The 25 richest programs in the country are taking in more obscene amounts of money than ever before, too. <b>6. Greg Hodnett dies in crash</b> (PennLive File Photo) The Jackson Township resident and 49-year-old Sprint Car driver hit the pit lane wall at BAPS Motor Speedway on Sept. 20, causing his car to flip. The York County Coroner ruled that he died on impact with the wall of blunt force trauma. <b>5. Pennsylvania State Wrestling</b> (AP Photo/Julie Jacobson) Cael Sanderson and the Nittany Lions snagged their third straight national championship and their seventh in eight years as four PSU wrestlers took individual titles as one of the more undersold dynasties in modern college sports rolled on. <b>4. Tragedies abound </b> Mere days before reporting to Penn State for what would&#x27;ve been his freshman year, track star Kristian Marche was shot in the back of the head by a pair of teenagers, according to Philadelphia police. Central Dauphin football player Harrison Fenstemaker was killed while riding his motorcycle in what Lebanon County was a DUI incident involving Richard Lee Via, 63. Former Penn State quarterback Sean Schellenger was stabbed to death near Rittenhouse Square in July. Michael White turned himself in and was charged with third-degree homicide, voluntary manslaughter and possession of an instrument crime. He claimed self-defense. Schnellenger and and White, who was making a food delivery on his bike, were in a dispute with a man in a car blocking the road, according to police. White&#x27;s attorney told Philly.com the case was about race and a drunk white man tackling a young black man. <b>3. Le&#x27;Veon Bell </b> Bell told ESPN in January that he would consider retiring if franchise tagged again. He hasn&#x27;t retired, but did not report to the team at any point in 2018. The Steelers said they didn&#x27;t know what Bell&#x27;s plan was until the Nov. 13 deadline for tagged players to report passed. Teammates went form publicly upset to understanding to tired of the storyline and consistently supportive of James Conner, who did shine in Bell&#x27;s absence. Conner, however, went down in Week 13 against the Los Angeles Chargers. The Steelers lost that game and two of the following three to blow their lead atop the AFC North and lose control of their playoff positioning. Without Bell, they need help from the Cleveland Browns and the Tennessee Titans and Indianapolis Colts to play into the New Year. Bell is set to become a free agent in 2019, unless he&#x27;s tagged again at a price well above $20 million. <b>2. Philadelphia Eagles, Super Bowl champions</b> (Mark Pynes | mpynes@pennlive.com)",

Count fourth-year defensive end Shareef Miller, third-year junior running back Miles Sanders, third-year guard Connor McGovern, fourth-year tackle Ryan Bates and possibly even fourth-year defensive tackle Kevin Givens in that mix. Miller, Sanders and McGovern were present at Bowl Media Day. All three said they will play in Penn State’s Jan. 1 Citrus Bowl matchup with Kentucky in Orlando. And all three basically said they wanted to concentrate on the game, not their 2019 plans. “My focus is on the season,’’ said Sanders, who ran for 1,223 yards and nine touchdowns in his first season as starter. Miller, a two-year starter who received third-team All-Big Ten honors this season, has compiled 25 tackles for loss and 12 sacks the last two seasons. Miller said he has made his decision but offered little detail other than to say he will have an announcement after the Kentucky game. “(I will) make an announcement after the bowl game” but I’m not focused on that right now,’’ Miller said. Earlier in the day, Franklin said he met with all of the potential early defectors and their families on the day after Penn State’s win over Maryland at Beaver Stadium that closed out the regular season. “So for us, where I think people kind of get confused there, is it really should be a very complementary process in decision-making,’’ Franklin said. “What I mean by that is, if the guy leaves early, and he’s a first- or second-round draft choice, that’s good for him and his family. That’s also good for Penn State football. If he leaves early, and gets drafted very late or not drafted at all, that’s bad for him and his family, and that’s bad for Penn State football.’’ Miller, asked about his meeting with Franklin after the Maryland game, said, “It was good. My family was in there, Coach Franklin was in there, Coach ‘Spence’ (defensive line coach Sean Spencer) was in there. “(We were) just talking about about possibly, if I leave or stay, what’s the best things for me. It was a real good meeting.’’ “It was helpful. l learned a couple new things,’’ McGovern said when asked about his meeting with Franklin. “I was able to see what other people outside the immediate family had to say. I have to make some decisions, but the day after the Maryland game, [Coach Franklin] brought us in, updated us on the process, and then just said about keeping him updated.” “We&#x27;re really working together here,’’ Franklin added. “What you hope you’ve done is over six years, the recruiting process, once they’ve showed up on campus, you develop that type of relationship with them and their family that you have that trust.”",

      "full": "<b>STATE COLLEGE -- </b>Penn State’s Brent Pry was asked to sum up the season linebacker Micah Parsons had in his first year as a Nittany Lion. One statistic summed it up best in the mind of the third-year defensive coordinator. “I think the fact that Micah led our defense in tackles, and started only one game, tells the tale a little bit,” Pry said. The Harrisburg product did play in all 12 games though, which helped him amass 69 tackles, three more than fellow linebacker Jan Johnson’s 66, through the 9-3 regular season. His lone start came at Rutgers due to Cam Brown being suspended for a violation of team rules, and Parsons turned the extra playing time into seven tackles (two for loss), a sack, and a forced fumble in the Lions November win over the Scarlet Knights. Parsons heads into the bowl game still listed as the backup at one outside linebacker spot behind starter Koa Farmer, but he figures to out snap the senior in the Citrus Bowl against No. 14 Kentucky in Orlando, Fla., just like he did for much of the second half of the season. “He’s got some growing to do, some maturing; my hat is off to him for the year he did put in,” Pry said. “A young man that had never played linebacker, and worked hard to learn it, played hard, didn’t allow things to slow him down when he wasn’t sure, so he had a very nice year.” After the Jan. 1 contest, the team’s focus will quickly turn to lifting, conditioning, and other preparations for the 2019 season, which opens Aug. 31 when Idaho visits Beaver Stadium. It will mark a chance for Pry’s defense to grow individually and as a unit, and Parsons figures to be a key part of it for at least a couple of years to come. “He’s got a big offseason in front of him,” Pry said. “Very high expectations he places on himself, and he’s got obviously great potential, so it’s going to be exciting moving forward.” If you purchase a product or register for an account through a link on our site, we may receive compensation.

      "full": "<b>STATE COLLEGE -- </b>James Franklin has completed his portion of Penn State&#x27;s bowl media day here on Friday morning. The head coach kicked off a few hours of interviews with coordinators and players by discussing recruiting, the Citrus Bowl opposite No. 14 Kentucky, and more. See the big takeaways from his roughly half hour session below. <b>How will Penn State handle Josh Allen?</b> Most of Franklin’s time at the podium focused on recruiting and his Nittany Lion players, but he was asked to address the nation’s top defensive player as voted by a number of foundations and media organizations, Josh Allen. The future first-round NFL Draft pick is going to play for the Wildcats on Jan. 1, and the Lions will need to know where the linebacker/end is before every snap. “The biggest thing is his length and athleticism, and how twitchy he is,” Franklin said. &quot;The way he’s been able to impact the game in so many ways, that’s probably what’s been so impressive, how twitchy he is, how productive he is, his length; in terms of what they’re looking for at the next level, he kind of fits the model. They’re trying, defensively, t put him In position to make plays, and we’re trying to do things to limit his impact. We better have an awareness of where he is on every single play.&quot; <b>Any NFL Draft decisions made yet?</b> In a word, no. Franklin said that he met with any junior who is thinking about declaring early for the NFL on the Sunday following the Maryland win. Parents were involved, as well, as were position coaches and support staffers so that there could be an honest, two-way conversation about what might be in each player’s best interest. “Obviously it’s a fluid conversation that’s constantly evolving and changing,” Franklin said. “We had put together a whole presentation, because to me, it’s not about convincing them to stay, it’s, let me give you all the information that I can get based on my resources and contact so you can make an educated decision and a great decision.” At this point, Penn State is not expecting any players to sit out the bowl game, but Franklin admitted that things could possibly change in that regard down the road. “Nothing new right now at this point,” he said. “Right now, we’re planning on having everyone for the game.” <b>No coach movement, yet</b> One key for Penn State’s sprint to National Signing Day on Dec. 19 is no staff changes, which is different from last year, when Joe Moorhead, Charles Huff, and Josh Gattis all left the staff. This year, there have not been any defections, but like the NFL decision process, that’s subject to change, too, as the offseason continues. “I’d like to keep our staff in tact as long as possible,” Franklin said. &quot;I think consistency is important, but I also understand that we’re at a point in our profession and in this game where that’s challenging. I “t’s critical for us to do everything we possibly can to create an environment here where it’s competitive and where guys want to come to work and feel good about it.

      "full": "<b>STATE COLLEGE -- </b>James Franklin has completed his portion of Penn State&#x27;s bowl media day here on Friday morning. The head coach kicked off a few hours of interviews with coordinators and players by discussing recruiting, the Citrus Bowl opposite No. 14 Kentucky, and more. See the big takeaways from his roughly half hour session below. <b>How will Penn State handle Josh Allen?</b> Most of Franklin’s time at the podium focused on recruiting and his Nittany Lion players, but he was asked to address the nation’s top defensive player as voted by a number of foundations and media organizations, Josh Allen. The future first-round NFL Draft pick is going to play for the Wildcats on Jan. 1, and the Lions will need to know where the linebacker/end is before every snap. “The biggest thing is his length and athleticism, and how twitchy he is,” Franklin said. &quot;The way he’s been able to impact the game in so many ways, that’s probably what’s been so impressive, how twitchy he is, how productive he is, his length; in terms of what they’re looking for at the next level, he kind of fits the model. They’re trying, defensively, t put him In position to make plays, and we’re trying to do things to limit his impact. We better have an awareness of where he is on every single play.&quot; <b>Any NFL Draft decisions made yet?</b> In a word, no. Franklin said that he met with any junior who is thinking about declaring early for the NFL on the Sunday following the Maryland win. Parents were involved, as well, as were position coaches and support staffers so that there could be an honest, two-way conversation about what might be in each player’s best interest. “Obviously it’s a fluid conversation that’s constantly evolving and changing,” Franklin said. “We had put together a whole presentation, because to me, it’s not about convincing them to stay, it’s, let me give you all the information that I can get based on my resources and contact so you can make an educated decision and a great decision.” At this point, Penn State is not expecting any players to sit out the bowl game, but Franklin admitted that things could possibly change in that regard down the road. “Nothing new right now at this point,” he said. “Right now, we’re planning on having everyone for the game.” <b>No coach movement, yet</b> One key for Penn State’s sprint to National Signing Day on Dec. 19 is no staff changes, which is different from last year, when Joe Moorhead, Charles Huff, and Josh Gattis all left the staff.

That cannot happen with the type of program we have and the type of program we want to be.”",

It’s the school’s Citrus Bowl media day. Things will kick off inside the south end zone interview room with Franklin taking to the podium just before 11 a.m. Coordinators Ricky Rahne, Brent Pry, and Phil Galiano will also speak, as will a smattering of players before practice is held later in the day. Running back Miles Sanders and Shareef Miller are both expected to answer questions, but it’s highly unlikely that either will address their post-bowl plans of staying in school or going to the NFL. Rahne will be available for the first time since roughly the middle of the season, though, and so it will be interesting to hear how he evaluates the progress of the offense over the second half and where things stand entering the bowl game. We’re likely to learn more about how Penn State will play its freshmen in the game, too, considering many have a game or more left to play without burning their redshirt season.

      "full": "I have always been a connoisseur of bad bowl games. Why? For the same reason I watch certain infomercials. It’s the cheesiness entertainment factor mixed with unpredictability. Add in a friendly wager on the game with beer and friends and nothing beats it. I mean, you know at least some of the players can’t get <i>that </i>jazzed up about a trip to Shreveport to play another 6-6 or 7-5 team. Which means anything can happen.

If it wasn’t for wagering of one sort or another, do you think anyone would watch these games? There’s no one in the stadiums other than friends and family. It’s all about the bet. That wasn’t always so at all. Fifty years ago is when I remember the true advent of the trash bowl. Back then, you had the four big bowl games and that was it. They were all on New Year’s Day. Lindsay Nelson did the Sugar Bowl and Frank Glieber did the Cotton Bowl on CBS. Curt Gowdy did the Rose Bowl and Jim Simpson the Orange Bowl on NBC. All big-time operations and respected announcers. Then, a broadcast syndicate called Television Sports (TVS), run by a New Jersey businessman named Eddie Einhorn, got involved. Up popped the first upstart bowls – the Peach, played in the muck of Atlanta’s Fulton County Stadium where the Braves and Falcons toiled; and the Astro-Bluebonnet Bowl, played in the then-space-age Astrodome, home of the Astros and Oilers. It seemed like the hometown Houston Cougars were always in it. Easier to half-fill the seats for a low-rent bowl that way. They were both done by TVS and the broadcast voice was the gee-whiz delivery of Merle Harmon, pretty much Einhorn’s promotional agent. No matter how bad the game was, Harmon would make it sound like the national championship was at stake. For a football-loving 11-year-old, the novelty of a bowl game <i>not</i> on New Year’s Day but on <i>New Year’s Eve</i> was intoxicating. We had sleepovers with friends and did our paper routes with early holiday delivery in the snow, then came back to watch the weird bowl game on this new plastic grass played <i>indoors.</i> I had acquired my trash bowl fix for life.",

Joe Hermitt | jhermitt@pennlive.com The Penn State mailbag is back in its usual Thursday spot as we take your questions and share our answers with National Signing Day, Part I now less than a week away. It won&#x27;t be long until the fax machines are churning inside the Lasch Building to officially link the Lions and a number of new players, but before that, we discuss: And much more. As always, questions can be submitted weekly via email to gpickel@pennlive.com or on Twitter to @GregPickel. Also, thanks to the Reddit college football community for hosting us for an &#x27;AMA&#x27; on Wednesday. Some of those questions and answers are featured this week, as well. Let&#x27;s get to it. <b>@nebs33 asks: </b> Any concern that we haven’t had a commit recently and some of our top targets may end up choosing OSU, UM or SEC? Nope, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s time for Penn State to be concerned about that yet. Not with recruits such as tackle Trevor Keegan (Friday) and back Noah Cain and receiver Cornelius Johnson (Signing Day Wednesday) set to decide within the next week. If none of those three pick the Lions, then they&#x27;ll be more cause for pause. As for your other point, of course it&#x27;s never good news when the Lions&#x27; top targets pick other major competitors, however, that is often the reality considering who the program is after, and other programs are on the wrong side of that equation when Penn State lands some of its verbal commitments. The long and short of it? It&#x27;s not time to worry yet. <b>@stroup_ben asks: </b> Anyone leaving early for the draft? Next recruits to commit? Penn State running back Miles Sanders runs during the first quarter on Nov. 24, 2018. Joe Hermitt | jhermitt@pennlive.com We are still waiting on NFL Draft decisions. End Shareef Miller, back Miles Sanders, and others are certainly gathering feedback as they prepare to make their stay or go call, but unless there is a surprise announcement at bowl media day on Friday, it feels more likely that those public declarations will come following the Citrus Bowl. As for the next recruit to commit, Penn State seems likely to get at least one of the three listed above -- Johnson, Keegan, and/or Cain -- so all of the signs point to the class&#x27; 17th member coming out of that group. <b>@ABruner18 asks: </b> Any potential coaching changes (departures/arrivals) that could happen? As we&#x27;ve been saying for a few weeks now, turnover in the coaching ranks is common anymore, and while we have no firm stats to back this next assertion up, it feels like many schools lose at least one coach each offseason for one reason or the other. With numerous head and assistant coaching jobs still open, it remains possible that a Penn State staffer could move on, but we have not seen any of James Franklin&#x27;s 10 assistants linked to other jobs yet. <b>@AdRockNYC asks: </b> Thoughts on CJ Holmes? After redshirting he should be in the mix for carries. Any chance he can be a major contributor next year? Penn State running back CJ Holmes during practice on Sept. 5, 2018. Joe Hermitt | jhermitt@pennlive.com It&#x27;s been a mistake not mentioning Holmes when looking ahead to next year&#x27;s backfield picture. Miles Sanders&#x27; decision will go a long way in helping to shape it, of course, but Holmes, who has been active on the scout team while sitting out this season due to transferring in from Notre Dame, seems to have all the skills that made him a coveted four-star recruit and Penn State target way back when. One can only assume that he&#x27;ll be able to earn a role on the field in 2019, regardless of whether he&#x27;s a running back, receiver, special teams contributor, or something else. <b>@Muggsynycz asks: </b> Speaking of true freshman, does Kentucky have anybody they held back that’ll probably play in the bowl game? Good question. It&#x27;s hard enough to parse the Penn State tea leaves when trying to guess which true freshmen will see extended action in the Citrus Bowl, let alone diving into the Kentucky side of things, but one name to watch is Kavosiey Smoke. The former three-star recruit from Alabama played in just one game this season, as he netted four carries for 45 yards in the Wildcats&#x27; win over Louisville. If Kentucky has junior back Benny Snell, who could leave early for the NFL Draft, on any kind of pitch count, Smoke might see some work, though Kentucky has a few other backs to work in as well.",

The Lions figure to be targeting a scholarship count in the low 20s for the 2019 recruiting class, which means coach James Franklin still has plenty of work to do to put a bow on the class. And make no mistake, Franklin has worked. He’s gone in-home with prospects, worked through a key campus recruiting weekend and shown up on the sideline of key players’ high school playoff games. Franklin and his staff are staying busy and sticking to a plan to reinforce their relationships with current pledges while trying to add more key targets to the class. As Franklin has zig-zagged his way up and down the East Coast, a handful of key names have emerged as priority targets for the last few spots in the class.

A Texas native, Cain has interest in Auburn, Georgia and Texas and has an unofficial visit planned to Tennessee this weekend. If Penn State can get to the finish line, Cain would rank among Franklin’s biggest late-cycle recruiting victories. <b>Trevor Keegan, OT, Crystal Lake South (Ill.)</b> The Lions are paying extra close attention to Keegan to round out an already-impressive collection of offensive line commits. Keegan is a massive 6-6, 310-pound athlete with a freshly released top three schools that includes Penn State along with Michigan and Georgia. The Lions are playing from behind in this one with hopes that a Dec. 7 official visit and last-minute in-homes with the Penn State coaches can help close the gap with Michigan. The Wolverines are still heavy favorites to land Keegan, the No. 17 offensive tackle in the country in the 247 composite. <b>Jakai Moore, OG, Patriot (Va.)</b> Penn State once looked like the prohibitive favorite to add Moore, a 6-6, 295-pound offensive lineman from Virginia. But Moore pumped the brakes on his recruitment and cut the final group down to two just this week in Penn State and South Carolina. Moore is long and versatile and has the aggressive disposition Penn State covets in an offensive lineman. He could be a nice consolation prize should Keegan choose Michigan as expected. Like current PSU commit Caedan Wallace, Moore is listed as a guard but could still develop into a tackle at the next level. He is expected to announce his decision on Dec. 19. <b>Jared Harrison-Hunte, Christ the King Regional (N.Y.)</b> Penn State has perhaps one more major hurdle to clear in its recruitment of Harrison-Hunte, a 6-4, 290-pound defensive tackle from Christ the King Regional in Middle Village, N.Y. A long and strong athlete with the movement skills to play tight end in high school, Harrison-Hunte is viewed as a PSU lean with a weekend visit planned to Miami. His athletic profile is impressive and he represents a key target a must-fill position. His recruitment is picking up late, but the Lions still look favorites to land him coming off a Dec. 7 official visit. In addition to the Miami interest, Harrison-Hunte also landed recent offers from Alabama and Michigan. <b>Cornelius Johnson, WR, Brunswick School (Conn.)</b> Johnson skyrockets to the top of Penn State’s 2019 board following three-star Emery Simmons’ flip back to North Carolina last weekend. Not only that, but once-promising target David Bell now looks to be a heavy Purdue lean whose final straw might have been coach Jeff Brohm’s decision to spurn Louisville to continue his build at Purdue. The Lions are in the market for a wide receiver and hope to make a late move with Johnson, a four-star from Connecticut who will choose from Penn State, Notre Dame, Michigan and Stanford. His announcement is scheduled for Dec. 19. <b>D&#x27;Von Ellies, DT, McDonogh School (Md.)</b> Along with Harrison-Hunte, Ellies is a must-watch name at the defensive tackle position late in the cycle. Penn State offered him in July and hosted him on an official visit for the Wisconsin game in November. The Lions are still viewed as leaders for the four-star from Maryland, who has the total package of power, quickness and leverage at 6-2 and 280 pounds. Ellies is expected to announce his college choice at the Polynesian Bowl on Jan. 19. He is likely to choose between Penn State and Ohio State. <b>Smith Vilbert, DE, St. Joseph Regional (N.J.)</b> Penn State is surging in the recruitment of Vilbert, a 6-6, 250-pound athlete from New Jersey. His 247Sports Crystall Ball is full of picks in the Lions’ favor late in the process as he comes off an official visit to Penn State last weekend. Oregon is also in the mix, and Miami and Florida are among the Power 5 programs to offer him over the past month. Vilbert’s length and athleticism give him big-time potential at the next level. The official to Penn State might have sealed the deal for the Lions, who likely won’t hear a decision until February. <b>SUCCESSES FROM THE PAST</b> If history is a road map for the future, Penn State should be much more successful than not closing the deal with its top priorities in the ’19 class. The Lions have managed to fill out their classes and land high-profile commitments late in most cycles under Franklin. The pieces are coming together in 2019, as well. <b>Micah Parsons, DE/LB, Harrisburg (2018)</b> Penn State linebacker Micah Parsons sacks Rutgers quarterback Artur Sitkowski forcing a fumble recovered by the Scarlet Knights during the first quarter at HighPoint.com Stadium on Nov. 17, 2018.

He is a quarterback and holder at State College High, and will join the team next year.

Jaden Seider, the son of Lion&#x27; running backs coach Ja’Juan Seider, announced on Tuesday night that he has accepted a preferred walk-on offer from Penn State. He is a quarterback and holder at State College High, and will join the team next year.

Dublin, Ohio four-star Class of 2020 recruit Michael Drennan II shared on social media Wednesday that the Lions have joined Michigan, Ohio State, and over 15 others in offering. The 5-foot-11, 190-pound runner is listed as the No. 3 back in his class, according to the 247Sports&#x27; Composite rankings, and is a top-200 player nationally. The Lions watched Drennan II at camp back in June, according to Lions247, and that evaluation combined with his junior tape led to the offer. Warren, Mich., three-star offensive lineman Grant Toutant is currently the Lions&#x27; only Class of 2020 verbal commitment. <b>Blackledge going into another Hall </b> Todd Blackledge can add another major honor to his lengthy list of accomplishments. The former Penn State All-American quarterback and national-title winner was selected as a member of the Sugar Bowl Hall of Fame’s Class. He and the rest of it will be honored and inducted at the Sugar Bowl on Jan. 1, 2019. Blackledge led the Lions to a Sugar Bowl victory to help clinch the 1982 national title, and he also has called six of its contests as a television analyst. <b>Freshmen, Oruwariye honored again</b> Micha Parsons and Pat Freiermuth have landed on another freshman All-American team. The linebacker and tight end, respectively, were listed on ESPN’s team of first-year stars on Wednesday. The duo also made similar teams released by The Athletic and 247Sports. In other postseason news, corner Amani Oruwariye was a first-team All-Big Ten pick by ESPN. He was also a conference first-team selection.

Former Owls coach Geoff Collins left for Georgia Tech last week, and the opening has perhaps brought some familiar names to the table. Schiano was a Penn State graduate assistant from 1991-’95. Gattis was wide receivers coach under James Franklin from 2014-’17 before leaving this offseason for Alabama, where he served as co-offensive coordinator. In other Penn State football news, a Class of 2019 commit flips to North Carolina. Kentucky coach Mark Stoops talks about the Citrus Bowl, and a look at how Pat Freiermuth became a local legend.

Head coach Mark Stoops&#x27; team brings NFL-bound back Benny Snell and a run-often offense into the New Year’s Day matchup at Camping World Stadium, but the SEC school will throw the ball a bit, too, which is why a scouting report of Kentucky’s receivers from PSU corners coach Terry Smith is helpful with the game set to kickoff just four days from now. “Obviously, their slots are their top receiver targets,” Smith told reporters after Penn State held its first practice in Florida on Thursday. &quot;Their starter [Lynn Bowden Jr.] is a Youngstown kid. He’s really talented, super-fast, super-quick. He’s their leading receiver. His backup [David Bouvier] is the second-leading receiver on the team. They try to get those guys the ball in space. “Their outside guys, they don’t do a lot with the underneath stuff, but they’ll take shots down the field. With Kentucky, it starts with the run game. They have a talented running back and their quarterback is a dual-threat guy. We have to contain those guys first and make sure No. 1 [Bowden] in the slot doesn’t get loose. Just wrap him up and contain him.” Smith did not address only this week’s opponent, though, as he touched on a number of topics including young Lions who are standing out, safety Lamont Wade’s development, and more. He is the feature of this week’s PSU PennLive Q&A, which comes courtesy of a transcript from Smith’s media session provided by Penn State. <i><b>Q: How’s the trip been so far?</b></i> <b>Smith:</b> The trip’s been fantastic. We’re in shorts. We haven’t seen shorts in a few months. We’re really, really appreciative to be down here in Orlando. It’s been a great gift for us to come to the Citrus Bowl and we’re enjoying the moment. Our team is just getting ready day-by-day. <i><b>Q: Lamont Wade hasn’t established himself as a starter. Where do you see him now and in the future?</b></i> <b>Smith:</b> Lamont [Wade] continues to get better. He’s a major factor on special teams for us, both as a freshman and a sophomore. He’s given us great depth this year in the secondary and continues to grow. Obviously, with the departure of Nick Scott, we’re looking for Lamont to step up [next year]. <i><b>Q: What would it mean to the program to have a very high draft pick as a cornerback?</b></i> <b>Smith</b>: We haven’t had a first-rounder. God willing, obviously it would be a blessing for Amani [Oruwariye] and his family. It would be a blessing for us as Penn State. We’re trying to build DB nation here. We’ve got seven or eight guys in the league right now that we’ve coached over the last five years. This thing is growing and growing fast. We’re trying to get the best guys in and develop those guys. Amani would be a huge step for the program. <i><b>Q: Who are some guys we haven’t seen that you’re getting a longer look at in the bowl practices?</b></i> <b>Smith:</b> In the secondary, obviously, Garrett [Taylor] is already playing. Lamont Wade we’ve already talked about. He’s going to get a shot. At the cornerback position, we have Donovan Johnson. He’s going to get an opportunity to play. Zechariah McPhearson will get an opportunity. Trent Gordon will get an opportunity. Jonathan Sutherland will get a shot at the safety position. Then, who knows which of those freshmen will come in and be a little more mature and be mentality and physically more equipped.",

That ends Dec. 16 when a one-day quiet period begins. That will mark the last day recruits can come to campus, but coaches cannot have contact with future student-athletes at their high school on that day. Then, when the dead period begins a day later, all coach travel to see prospects and vice versa is suspended for a little less than a month. <b>Dec. 19: Early National Signing Day period begins </b> This is the second year with an early signing period, and Penn State will expect to sign all 17 of its current Class of 2019 commits. Most recruits nationwide who are ready to put pen to paper will submit their National Letter of Intent this day, but the period does have some wiggle room as it runs until Dec. 21.

Camping World Stadium will host the contest at 1 p.m., and key questions remain, such as whether or not star Wildcats defender Josh Allen, who was named the top defender in the nation recently, will play. <b>Jan. 2 and beyond: Who will stay, go?</b> Penn State typically sees some attrition after its bowl game, either for medical reasons, academic intentions, playing time concerns, and so on and so forth. Once the postseason ends, the changes start coming in. <b>Jan. 3: Under Armour All-American game</b> Five-star linebacker Brandon Smith, four-star quarterback Michael Johnson Jr., four-star running back Devyn Ford, and four-star receiver John Dunmore will represent the Lions in the Under Armour All-American game this year.

(Ford Field) This used to be the Motor City Bowl, brainstorm of former Michigan State coach Gerorge Perles who also gave us the Land Grant Trophy. Now it’s called the QuickLane Bowl named after a convenience oil/lube business. Can you imagine Paul Johnson (in his last game at GT, no less) and P.J. Fleck trying to sell this to their players? “Hey, guess where we’re going for Christmas, guys?! I’ll give you a hint. It starts with Mi. No, not Miami…” Considering how unlikely a bowl – any bowl – was for Minnesota after week 10 when it sat at 4-5 with Purdue, Northwestern and @Wisconsin on deck, the Gophers must feel good about themselves. Still, no one on Minnesota’s team has faced a triple-option attack in college. It probably won’t be pleasant. The Gophers have proven vulnerable to run-based offenses this season (42-13 loss to Maryland, 55-31 loss to Illinois), though they patched it up some in the finale @Wisconsin. Tech is a whole different animal and if the Gophers are the slightest out of their lanes on defense a big play (of which Minnesota allowed many in 2018) can result. It’s also a guaranteed fast track at Ford Field and the Gophers aren’t. I like the Jackets (-3 ½) to cover and send Johnson out with a bouquet. Georgia Tech 41, Minnesota 24. The way I look at it, this game is due for weather like the 1968 AFL championship game at Shea. Except there&#x27;ll be quite a bit less at stake. <b>Hey, Who Wants to Freeze Their Ass Off Pinstripe Bowl</b> Wisconsin vs. Miami Dec. 27 – 5:15 EST (ESPN) Bronx, N.Y. (Yankee Stadium) Can you imagine the Canes’ delight when Mark Richt gave ‘em this news? We&#x27;re playing who where? … C&#x27;mon, man. Yes, it’s Wisconsin. Again. And this time, it could be like 12°. Bucky already won this game in Miami last year. Why wouldn’t the Badgers be able to do this same thing in Yankee Stadium? Well, because they have not been themselves pretty much all season and lost every meaningful game other than a comeback win at Iowa. Yeah, well, Miami has been worse. The Hurricanes lost four straight late – to Virginia, Boston College, Duke and Georgia Tech no less – to wreck their season. They are a notoriously bad bowl team and then we get to the weather. We can’t know what it’ll be like in three weeks but long-range forecasts are confidently calling for a colder than normal winter. In NYC, trust me, that means normal people won’t even go to the convenience store for milk let alone sit in Yankee Stadium. Of course, Wisconsin fans aren’t normal. I like their team’s chances, especially as a +4 dog, double-especially once Jonathan Taylor’s engine gets warm. Wisconsin 27, Miami 16. Mortgage banker guys with Tennessee coach Butch Jones, now out of football. <b>What Genius Decided to Name a Game in Nashville After a Mortgage Lender Bowl</b> Purdue vs. Auburn Dec. 28 – 1:30 EST (ESPN) Nashville, Tenn. (Nissan Stadium) This is Music City U.S.A, right? Couldn’t Kenny Chesney or Blake Shelton pitch in then just choose a name based on one of their endorsements? How cool would it be to play in the Fender Deluxe Music City Bowl? Or how about the Gibson Les Paul Black Beauty Bowl? When Hartford, Connecticut gets a bowl, by all means, then name it after a mortgage company. The Boilermakers have to be feeling great after Jeff Brohm turned down his alma mater to stay with them. That was a serious shocker not just to me but just about everyone in West Lafayette. If ever a team should be revved up to play a bowl, it&#x27;s this one. And that is so often the key to who wins – who wants to be there and maybe who doesn&#x27;t. In that sense, Auburn is slumming here. The Tigers were disappointed at being stuck in the Peach Bowl last season against Central Florida after being a step away from the Playoff, and it showed in a 34-27 upset loss as 10-point favorites. This game has to be a hundred times less inspiring. Purdue only became bowl-eligible because of a win over Indiana and is a +4 dog. But I think David Blough (in his final college game) and the Boilers can throw on AU and I like them to win outright. Purdue 35, Auburn 24. You can still sneak in some Popeye&#x27;s in your parka. <b>Why Don&#x27;t We Just Get a Chick-fil-A Sandwich and Forget it Peach Bowl</b> Michigan vs. Florida Dec. 29 – Noon EST (ESPN) Atlanta, Ga. (Mercedes-Benz Stadium) Part of the fun of bowl games is supposed to be matching teams who rarely if ever see each other. Y’know, like Florida and Central Florida? But the businessmen of Atlanta didn’t want to get socked with the Group of 5 team for the third time in five years. And Florida wanted no part of playing UCF anyway. So, they all decided: Let’s get Jim Harbaugh! I guess they heard he was the next big thing. Anyway, this is the third time in four seasons these teams have met, both previous games won by the Wolverines (41-7 in the 2015 Citrus Bowl; 33-17 in a neutral-site season-kickoff game in 2017). What did Harbaugh do? He hired the fired UF coach he beat up both years, Jim McElwain, as some sort of co-OC. McElwain just got the Central Michigan job, so he won’t be around for this one. Dan Mullen is now coaching the Gators. They have to run to be effective and can’t consistently score otherwise. Meanwhile, Michigan should find UF’s generous run defense appetizing. There’s just this one thing: Mullen gets my check mark in the coaching matchup. I’ll gladly accept the +7 ½ in what could be a rock fight and take my chances. Gators could easily win outright. Michigan 23, Florida 21. Filling it with 12 copies of Grown-Ups 2. <b>I Looked Through Redbox and All They Had Was Stupid Adam Sandler Movies Bowl</b> Michigan State vs. Oregon Dec. 31 – 3:00 EST (FOX) Santa Clara, Calif. (Levi’s Stadium) This used to be the Foster Farms Bowl and, apparently, they’d seen enough. So, Redbox, the DVD movie kiosk, decided to step up and sponsor this annual slogfest in the 49ers soulless new stadium where they’re playing the CFP championship. At least it won’t be in September, where patrons commonly fry to death in the stadium’s ventilation-starved, surface-of-Mercury heat vortex. These teams have a history but it was mainly during happier times. Some of the seniors were around during a couple of crackerjack games in 2014 (won by the Ducks in Eugene, 46-27) and 2015 (won by Sparty in East Lansing, 31-28). Both winning teams ended up in the College Football Playoff, the Ducks playing for the 2014 title. Alas, these teams are not those. Michigan State suffered a historic rash of injuries and hasn’t been able to score, but its defense has been the Big Ten’s best. Oregon can’t stop an offense of any worth at all but has scored on just about everyone. So, it’s at least an intriguing matchup. It’ll be interesting to see if MSU quarterback Brian Lewerke’s shoulder has finally gotten well. If it has, advantage Sparty, especially as a +3 dog. Michigan State 31, Oregon 21. It&#x27;s not a body or anything just an old railing where nobody sits anymore. <i>Dustin Michelson</i> <b>We Have a New Sponsor Again and Our Stadium Could Collapse on Itself at Any Minute Holiday Bowl</b> No. 22 Northwestern vs. No. 17 Utah Dec. 31 – 7:00 EST (FS1) San Diego, Calif. (SDCCU Stadium) Remember when this was the SeaWorld Holiday Bowl and it was played in Jack Murphy Stadium and they had all those nutty games where one team or the other made a miracle comeback and either Brigham Young or San Diego State seemed to be it every year? Yeah. That was a long time ago. Now we get matchups like this one. This actually could’ve been the Rose Bowl. I was so hoping for that, imagining those crusty old codgers from the Tournament of Roses committee grumbling to themselves and passing the time during the game with stories about Bo Schembechler at Lawry’s that nobody else remembers and planning Bob Hope for next year’s Grand Marshal. The Holiday Bowl doesn&#x27;t have any of that. But they do have a bowl where an entire game could be played between the 20s. Utah was so inert in the 10-3 loss to Washington in the Pac-12 championship game that I started flipping around and stopped on 2018 Phillies season highlights. Northwestern will be quarterbacked by Clayton Thorson for the 53<sup>rd</sup> and, our records indicate, final time. Not sticking around for the finish but I&#x27;m calling for five 4<sup>th</sup>-quarter punts and a victory formation. Northwestern 17, Utah, 12. No throwing the boomerang. <b>Can&#x27;t Get a Decent Steak Around Here Tampa Bowl</b> Iowa vs. Mississippi State Jan. 1 – Noon ET (ESPN2) Tampa, Fla. (Raymond James Stadium) Everyone of a certain age on the Penn State beat never refers to the Outback Bowl as anything but “the Tampa Bowl” because of the ultimate anti-advertising backhand swipe made on the victory podium. It was made by Joe Paterno at the end of the post-2006 Outback Bowl, a nondescript 20-10 win over favored Tennessee. “We’ve had a great time here at the Tampa Bowl,” said Paterno, purposely omitting the sponsor name before he added something about wishing he could’ve found a decent steak somewhere. The frozen smile on the Outback chieftain’s face was almost worth sitting through the tedious game. This one might be worse. Vegas has set the number at a basement-level 44 ½. MSU’s first-year offensive super-genius Joe Moorhead has had to make do with an ill-fitting QB to his system in Nick Fitzgerald and the results have been erratic. But Bob Shoop’s defense has looked good more often than not. Both know exactly what they’re dealing with in Iowa and vice versa with Kirk Ferentz. This is Iowa’s third trip to Tampa in five years so we’re not exactly talking electricity in the air. There’ll be few surprises and even fewer dynamic weapons on display. It’s hard to limbo under 44 ½ but this’ll be close. I will take Iowa with a generous +6 ½. Mississippi State 24, Iowa 21. The last time Penn State played in the Citrus Bowl, nine years ago against Louisiana State, the re-sodded field didn&#x27;t respond too well. <i>PennLive/Joe Hermitt</i> <b>I Kinda Wish They Were Playing the Kentucky Basketball Team VRBO Citrus Bowl</b> Penn State vs. Kentucky",

      "full": "Penn State is hosting a number of key recruiting targets this weekend. The Lions will have official and unofficial, plus committed and uncommitted, visitors alike on campus for multiple days starting on Friday, as head coach James Franklin has made this weekend a priority over the last few years on the recruiting front, and this year is no different. Longtime quarterback commit Ta’Quan Roberson, from DePaul, N.J., headlines the official visitor commit list along with four-star Princeton, N.J., guard Caedan Wallace. They’ll be joined on campus by another offivial visitor and four-star recruit, uncommitted 6-foot-3, 195-pound Greenwhich, Conn., senior receiver Cornelius Johnson, as well. He’s considering Stanford, Notre Dame, and Michigan too with an announcement set for January. According to 247Sports, the Lions will also host four-star Illinois tackle Trevor Keegan, four-star New York defensive lineman Jared Harrison-Hunte, and three-star Virginia guard Jakai Moore, among potentially others. All are repeat visitors, and the Lions are in the hunt to sweep the trio away from other schools. That’s not a guarantee, but it’s a possibility, and even going two of three in this group would be considered a success. Moore has long been viewed as a Penn State lean even though he hasn’t yet committed, and PSU has positioned itself quite well with Harrison-Hunte. It’s a good segue to this question: Will the Lions land a new commit over the next few days? This weekend has typically been about committed prospects gathering in the past, which means commitments have been few and far between; current freshman receiver K.J. Hamler did commit last Dec. 9, but he was not on campus. Ultimately, Moore and Harrison-Hunte both seem to like Penn State well enough to eventually pull the trigger and commit to the Lions, but considering that both have waited this long, it feels like a surprise would have to happen for the program’s current 17-member recruiting Class of 2019 to grow before next Monday.",

The Lions jumped the Buckeyes in the standings, though both programs saw their total attendance decline. Josh Moyer from the Centre Daily Times took a look at Big Ten commissioner Jim Delany’s comments about potential changes to how the conference decides a champion.

The Broncos (6-6) lost leading wide receiver Emmanuel Sanders to a ruptured left Achilles tendon on Wednesday. He was hurt in a non-contact drill at the beginning of practice. The 31-year-old receiver was placed on injured reserve and on Wednesday night he tweeted , &quot;If you know me then you know nothing can keep me down. I&#x27;ve overcome too much in life to let this stop me. I&#x27;ll be back next year w/ a bigger chip on my shoulder ... I PROMISE!&quot; The Broncos quickly claimed wide receiver Andre Holmes off waivers from Buffalo, giving them a seventh-year veteran to go with their four remaining receivers, all of whom made their NFL debuts this season. Sanders, who led the team with 71 catches for 868 yards and four touchdowns in a bounce-back year, was injured on a routine route.

      "full": "For the second consecutive season, Southern Columbia junior wide receiver Julian Fleming was honored as the Class 2A Player of the Year. The title coincides with the Thursday release of the Pa. Football Writers’ All-State Team. Fleming, the nation’s No. 5 junior prospect and reigning Pa. Gatorade Player of the Year, hauled in 80 catches for 1,526 yards and 22 touchdowns for the Tigers. The 6-3, 215-pounder recently shaved his offer list to 10 schools, with Penn State, Alabama, Virginia Tech, Ohio State and Michigan among them. Since 2009, sports writers who cover high school football around the Commonwealth have overseen the all-state process. Players are nominated in all six classifications, and then a statewide ballot is issued to afford all writers the opportunity to cast their votes. Steered by Fleming, Southern Columbia (16-0) led the way with seven selections, including RB Gaige Garcia, who totaled five touchdowns in the Tigers’ 49-14 triumph over Wilmington in the PIAA final earlier this month. The title was No. 9 overall for the Tigers. Wilmington picked up five selections, with Brandon Phillian picking up coach of the year honors.

(AP Photo/Timothy D. Easley) AP This is the multi-million dollar question, quite literally. Allen, a defensive end/linebacker, is the perfect example of a player who could have left school early and potentially went either in the later rounds or simply undrafted. Instead, he returned to school, refined his craft while adding some weight, and became the nation&#x27;s top defender as the Bronco Nagurski award winner and the SEC&#x27;s defensive player of the year. The decision earned him millions, as he&#x27;s projected to go in the top-15. Last year&#x27;s 15th overall pick, Radiers&#x27; rookie lineman Kolton Miller, agreed to a deal worth over $13 million.

History says they won&#x27;t be the only two who move on. As for space left, Penn State is looking at probably no more than seven additions to its 17-member Class of 2019, but the more likely number of extra adds is in the three-to-five range. <b>@BrandonStitt asks: </b> Do we really have a chance to flip Nolan Smith?

Smith is the nation&#x27;s No. 1 overall player according to 247Sports and a current Georgia verbal commit, but he visited Penn State last weekend and called it the best weekend of his life. High praise, right? The odds of flipping him still remain extraordinarily small, as he&#x27;s a Georgia native even though he plays at IMG Academy in Florida.

James Franklin has typically been quick to make personnel moves that he feels are warranted, so making one at this point if he hasn&#x27;t already feels like it would be out of character. That said, the early signing period does change things, as making a move before recruits ink their National Letter of Intent could lead some to look elsewhere. That said, coach movement is common in this day and age, and there are still jobs to be filled and spots to be had elsewhere. <b>@JWalizerJr asks: </b> Do you think Franklin will have a true QB competition in the spring? Or are the keys being handed to Stevens? Penn State quarterback Tommy Stevens looks downfield during the second quarter on Nov. 10, 2018. Joe Hermitt | jhermitt@pennlive.com Tommy Stevens has earned the right to be the leader in the clubhouse, but those following how the program fills open starting jobs know that Franklin will allow the competition between the senior-to-be and Sean Clifford, among others, to play out. That said, there is no question that No. 2 has earned himself a commanding lead in the race to be No. 1, even if Clifford was very good in the little action he received this year. <b>@dhrea1 asks: </b> In your opinion, should Miles Sanders declare for the draft or stay another year? It&#x27;s really a simple question: Can he improve his draft stock by coming back for his senior season? Sanders proved a lot in 2018 as he was able to hold up in a feature back role and not miss time due to injury or otherwise. Ball security is a known issue but can be cleaned up at the next level. Same can be said for pass protection. The strength of this year&#x27;s draft class will certainly come into play, and that&#x27;s not yet clear with a few juniors still waiting to decide as Sanders is. It&#x27;s hard to make a major argument toward one or the other being a major positive or negative. <b>@dutchmig358 asks: </b> With OSU and MD getting knew head coaches, is the B1G HC landscape finished changing? How do those hires affect PSU recruiting in the East moving forward? Ohio State NCAA college football offensive coordinator Ryan Day answers questions during a news conference announcing his hiring as head coach to replace Urban Meyer, who announced his retirement Tuesday, Dec. 4, 2018, in Columbus, Ohio. (AP Photo/Jay LaPrete) AP This season? I would say that answer is yes. Ryan Day is now in charge at Ohio State, and Mike Locksley is at Maryland. Jeff Brohm is staying at Purdue, and no other changes appear imminent, though coaches like Rutgers&#x27; Chris Ash, Minnesota&#x27;s P.J. Fleck, Wisconsin&#x27;s Paul Chryst, and probably a few others will enter the new season on the proverbial hot seat should things not start well. As for Penn State recruiting in the east, I really don&#x27;t see it changing much at all. Locksley will breath fresh air into Maryland, but they&#x27;ll need to win to draw the recruits Penn State has been cherrypicking out of the state. The Buckeyes, then, shouldn&#x27;t see a huge drop off either, even with Urban Meyer on the way out. <b>@Brocopio26 asks: </b> Why are there two bye weeks next season? Just the way the schedule works out. Penn State has an open date Sept. 21 and also Nov. 2 but has a full slate otherwise of three non-conference foes (Buffalo, Idaho, Pittsburgh) and nine Big Ten dates at Michigan State, Maryland, Iowa, Minnesota, and Ohio State and home versus Purdue, Michigan, Indiana, and Rutgers. <b>@420Tadition asks: </b> How’s 2019 class shaping up to be, will it show progress or plateau? Fair question here. Penn State, due to numbers, will be hard-pressed to live up to its top-10 class from a year ago, but this class, headlined by five-star linebacker commit Brandon Smith and four-star back Devyn Ford and guard Caedan Wallace continues to move things in the right direction. Right now, the glaring hole is along the defensive line, especially at defensive tackle, but there is time, and more importantly top targets left on the board, to address that. <b>@corbinwood57 asks: </b> What is the news on recruiting trail and are we in any serious contention for Zach Harrison? Penn State recruit Zach Harrison visits for the Whiteout against Ohio State on Sept. 29, 2018. Joe Hermitt | jhermitt@pennlive.com Penn State has and continues to make a heck of an effort to land Harrison, one of the nation&#x27;s top players and a five-star senior defensive end from Ohio, but it has always felt like the Lions were on the outside looking in, even if they had their foot in the door, and nothing recently has changed that. Ohio State and Michigan lead. <b>@WilliamPJones asks: </b>",

      "full": "For many Penn State fans, it’s probably hard to keep track of the various Big Ten head coaches from year to year, especially considering the ever-accelerating turnover rate, let alone their various assistants. But your team has had plenty of close encounters with the new Maryland head coach, about to be announced Thursday morning, even if you don’t remember them. Mike Locksley not only head coached a game against Penn State for the Terrapins in 2015 after Randy Edsall was fired (remember the wild 31-30 game in Baltimore?), he also was the single biggest reason behind Illinois’ shocking resurrection in the mid-‘00s. You may recall the Illini, just two years after being destroyed by Penn State 63-10, beating the Nittany Lions 27-20 in 2007 on the way to a wholly unexpected visit to the Rose Bowl (where they were thrashed by Pete Carroll’s #7-ranked Southern California Trojans, 49-17). You might ask: How did that happen at Illinois, anyway? Locksley mined his home turf of the District of Columbia and vicinity for Illini head coach Ron Zook and brought in future NFL talent such as CB Vontae Davis, LB Nate Bussey and WR Arellious Benn, that’s how. Once Locksley left to be head coach at New Mexico in 2008, the Illini plunged right back to Big Ten oblivion, where they’ve resided since. Mike Locksley has been, along with Larry Johnson (of Penn State and now Ohio State) and Fred Jackson (retired, previously of Wisconsin, Purdue and Michigan), among the elite recruiters in the modern history of the Big Ten. He has a reputation among high school coaches and player families in the DMV region (DC-MD-VA) around Washington and surrounding counties unmatched by anyone other than perhaps Johnson. Locksley has had two previous stints at Maryland as an assistant. Meanwhile, Maryland has an atmosphere around its program since the Jordan McNair tragedy that can only be termed radioactive. Effective recruiting, at least in the near-term, has been viewed as virtually impossible. It’s not that anyone has identified Locksley as necessarily ready to take on the CEO responsibilities of a Power Five job. In his only previous gig as a head coach (2009-11), his New Mexico Lobos went 2-26 and he was fired after a chaotic string of events that included a fistfight with an assistant and a sex- and age-discrimination lawsuit filed by a program administrator. She claimed Locksley told her they needed more hot younger women around the program for recruiting purposes – an accusation he denied. So, even though Locksley has been cooling his heels with Nick Saban as Alabama’s co-OC the past three seasons, he was not considered a hot-ticket hire by any school in the Power Five – except one. And even that one, Maryland, passed him over three years ago when they hired D.J. Durkin. That’s why he departed UMd (where he’d been Edsall’s OC) for Bama in the first place. So, the decision by Maryland to sign Locksley could not be more utilitarian. Call it gratuitous or expedient or whatever you like, but it fits the immediate needs of Maryland football. The Terrapins must fix their broken recruiting machine <i>now </i>or it might be unfixable. No matter his head coaching acumen, Locksley accomplishes that goal. Nobody has stronger ties and greater cred among the high schools of the DMV that commonly produce elite-level talent – St. Francis Xavier, DeMatha Catholic, St. John’s College, Gonzaga College, Friendship Academy, Dunbar, Woodson and on and on. Everybody who matters knows him. Amid the sort of public fiasco that’s gone on at Maryland with the suspension, retention and eventual dismissal of Durkin, do the Terps really need <i>this </i>guy and his baggage crash landing into College Park? Couldn’t they have made a play on a do-more-with-less type from a Group of 5 school out to triple his salary, like Buffalo’s Lance Leipold or Appalachian State’s Scott Satterfield (since hired by Louisville)? I don’t think they could have. I think it’s pretty much like this: Maryland can’t hire anyone else with a decent pedigree. And “Locks” can’t <i>get</i> hired anywhere else. At least not in the Power Five. Right now, they fit together and meet each other’s aims perfectly. And if he turns out to be Willie Taggart North as a coach, well, at least UMd will have stocked some talent. How will this affect Penn State and the rest of the Big Ten East? Everyone in the division pays plenty of attention to the DMV and all parts of Maryland, Virginia and the mid-Atlantic. It’s commonly the most fertile recruiting ground in the Big Ten footprint. That’s one of the main reasons Jim Delany asked Maryland into the conference. So, the Locksley hiring is very much on the antennae of OSU’s Johnson and PSU’s James Franklin both of whom know him well; Franklin and Locksley, in fact, were on Ralph Friedgen’s Maryland staff together for two years (2000-02) as young up-n-comers. Johnson gained his coaching chops at DMV high schools for nearly two decades before he came to Penn State in 1996. Both have recruited on and off against Locksley for many years.",

Joe Hermitt | jhermitt@pennlive.com Welcome to the final PennLive Penn State mailbag of 2018. It&#x27;s hard to imagine just how quickly the regular season flew by, as the Lions finished 9-3 to earn a Citrus Bowl date opposite Kentucky, let alone the rest of the year that came before it. Dating all the way back to January, Penn State finished with a top-10 recruiting Class of 2018, picked up a handful of verbal commitments before spring practice, and then rolled into summer camp knowing that many old faces would need to be replaced and many new names would have to fill the stat sheet. Ultimately, James Franklin&#x27;s fifth season with the Lions played out just as most thought it would, and now they are spending Day 2 in Orlando, Fla., ahead of their Jan. 1 postseason matchup that will offer a chance to win 10 or more games for the third year in a row. At any rate, we&#x27;ll do plenty of looking ahead while also reminiscing about some of the highs and lows from the year that was in this week&#x27;s mailbag, and thanks as always for all of your questions and comments over the last 360 days or so to keep this piece moving. This week, we discus: And much more. Let&#x27;s get to it. <b>@porakapooloza asks: </b> Are current players allowed to contact recruits during ‘dead periods’? The NCAA does not have terribly clear rules when it comes to player contact with recruits. It&#x27;s a bit of a grey area, but previously, it hasn&#x27;t really been kosher for current players to contact recruits when they are not on campus. That said, we see it on social media all the time, and so it almost feels as if the NCAA figures it cannot properly police it and thus lets most of it slide. As for coaches, they are allowed to have electronic communication with players during a dead period, but Class of 2020 players must initiate that contact. It&#x27;s a lot of direct messages and texts this time of year. <b>@MJtheHef asks</b> What’s the cliff notes version of how many players need to declare early / leave this summer to make our scholarship numbers work given current and expected/hopeful signings in Feb? Penn State head coach James Franklin, center, makes his way onto the field with captains Blake Gillikin, Nick Scott, Koa Farmer and Trace McSorley on Sept. 14, 2018.

It’s why you look around the country and staff sizes are what they are. Michigan has 13 more football-specific staff members than we do. It is challenging. I don’t think there’s any doubt about it. ... It’s all hands on deck.” In this week’s Penn State notes package, we dissect the following: And more. Let’s jump into the latest nuggets as head coach James Franklin and his team continue their march to the Citrus Bowl, which will be held Jan. 1 in Orlando, Fla., opposite the No. Wildcats. Kentucky linebacker Josh Allen (41) dives on the fumble of Georgia quarterback Jake Fromm (11) during the first half an NCAA college football game in Lexington, Ky., Saturday, Nov. 3, 2018. (AP Photo/Bryan Woolston) <b>Wormley earns top honor</b> Many of Penn State’s 17 Class of 2019 verbal commitments will earn all-area and all-state honors over the next few weeks as prep seasons across the country start to end and award lists roll out. One has already picked up such accolades. Smyrna, Del., guard Saleem Wormley was a first-team all-state pick and also was named Delaware’s offensive lineman of the year after he helped blow open holes and protect the pocket for the Eagles’ attack. He played tackle in high school, but the 6-foot-4, 300-pound mauler is expected to move inside at the next level. Penn State recruit Saleem Wormley visits for the Whiteout against Ohio State on Sept. 29, 2018. Joe Hermitt | jhermitt@pennlive.com “I grew up liking Penn State and I always liked the school,” Wormley said back when he committed in June. “When I visited I loved the campus and the overall feeling I got from being there.” “Coach Franklin and the staff he has put together, including the recruiting class he is putting together this year.” Wormley is one of three offensive linemen in the current class, as he’s joined by Princeton, N.J., four-star guard Caedan Wallace and three-star Lackawanna College tackle Anthony Whigan. It’s unlikely that any of the three see action right away next season, but the new redshirt rule, which allows players to participate in up to four games without burning a season of eligibility, has opened up plenty of opportunity in that regard. <b>Could the Lions steal Smith? </b> Penn State recruit Nolan Smith and his family pose with the Nittany Lions coaching staff and freshman linebacker Micah Parsons during an official visit last weekend. Photo courtesy Nolan Smith via Twitter. Penn State has made few waves in the recruiting world since the 2018 regular season began, as the Lions have netted just three pledges between September and now; in that stretch, they’ve only picked up only Class of 2019 defensive back pledge Joey Porter Jr. in September, Illinois tight end Brenton Strange in October, and Class of 2020 lineman Grant Toutant from Michigan last month. Last weekend, however, the Lions had a surge of momentum, and it had nothing to do with a commitment. Instead, it featured a five-star recruit coming to town, as the nation’s No. 1 senior prospect, Savannah, Ga., end Nolan Smith, took an official visit to campus despite being verbally committed to Georgia. By the time he left, Smith was clearly thrilled with the experience, tweeting that “this weekend with a true players coach was the best weekend of my life.” Prospects have been known to call their most recent visit the best one they’ve ever had, and that’s certainly true at Penn State, where the red carpet is rolled out from start to finish and the highlights numerous as locker room and campus tours, meetings with the coaching staffs, chances to interact with players, and more headline the time in town. What does it ultimately mean for the Lions and their chances to get Smith? Behind the scenes, freshman linebacker Micah Parsons already had a relationship with Smith, and that played a big part in his decision to visit and likely his weekend of enjoyment, too. He plays at IMG Academy in Florida, which shows a willingness to be away from home, but he committed to the Bulldogs last January and hasn’t backed away despite visits to Tennessee, Alabama, and PSU since according to 247Sports. The long and short of it moving forward? Certainly don’t count on it, but the fact that Lions could snare a late visit says plenty about how the program is viewed by recruits locally and nationally, and that might be as meaningful as anything unless Smith would pull the opposite shocker and flip to the Lions before signing day. <b>Will both teams have their star running backs in the Citrus Bowl? </b> Much was made about whether or not Penn State running back Miles Sanders would declare for the NFL Draft after the regular season, but he’s made no decision about his future entering the Citrus Bowl. Kentucky’s running back is facing a similar decision. Belly Snell Jr., the guy who makes the Wildcats’ offense go, finished his team’s 9-3 season 1,305 rushing yards and 14 touchdowns while averaging five yards a carry. He recorded just 17 receptions, but can occasionally be used in the passing game, as well. Kentucky running back Benny Snell Jr. (26) runs through an opening in the Louisville defensive line during the first half of an NCAA college football game in Louisville, Ky., Saturday, Nov. 24, 2018. (AP Photo/Timothy D. Easley) AP “Snell is a physical runner with a powerful build that makes him tough to get on the ground. He uses his strength, stature, knee bend, and ability to run behind his pads to pick up a lot of yards after contact,” Walter Football writes in an evaluation. The outlet ranks Snell as the draft class’ No. 3 back should he decide to declare early. For what it’s worth, Sanders is surprisingly unranked. “On top of natural running ability with good instincts, Snell has quickness to hit the hole and pull away.” “As of now, I’m playing in the bowl game. I’m not done yet,” Snell said in November, according to SB Nation. “To add on to this, it’s not really important, but I keep it in my mind. The all-time rushing record, I got 100 tonight, so I need 100 more, and the bowl game would help me with that.” Time will tell if he decides too, though. <b>And what will Josh Allen do?</b> Kentucky linebacker Josh Allen (41) greets fans before the NCAA college football game against Louisville in Louisville, Ky., Saturday, Nov. 24, 2018. (AP Photo/Bryan Woolston) AP Josh Allen, who lines up at end and linebacker for Kentucky and is pegged as a top-15 2019 NFL Draft pick, has a big decision to make, too, as he’ll have injury concerns to consider in the bowl game while he continues to debate whether or not he&#x27;ll suit up to take on the Nittany Lions. Allen was named the Bronko Nagurski award winner as the nation’s top defensive player on Monday night and was also picked as the SEC’s top defender by the Associated Press, and he is going to be a draft darling as the buzz builds for April’s selection process. “As of right now, I anticipate a full roster, but I can’t answer that 100 percent at this point in time,” Kentucky coach Mark Stoops said on Sunday. That said, Allen basically middle the question when asked after Kentucky finished its regular season by beating Louisville. “Just like the decision I made to come back (to school),” Allen said, again according to SB Nation. “It will be the same process. “I have a whole month, almost two months to decide what I’m going to do, what’s best for my family and the team. It’s going to be a decision I have to make, but we’ll see. We’ll see when the bowl game comes around.” Penn State certainly wouldn’t mind if he sits it out, as Allen is a key part of Kentucky’s top-25 total defense. <b>The final word</b> The countdown is on to National Signing Day, part one, and the Nittany Lions will host some prospects this weekend to help bridge the gap between now and then. According to 247Sports, the Lions will host: Penn State recruit Jared Harrison-Hunte visits for the Whiteout against Ohio State on Sept. 29, 2018. Joe Hermitt | jhermitt@pennlive.com",

      "full": "Urban Meyer leads his Ohio State team onto the field at Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis on Saturday for the Big Ten championship game against Northwestern. <i>AP/Darron Cummings</i> By David Jones/PennLive Urban Meyer officially quit as the head coach at Ohio State this afternoon. At the age of 54, he says he’s retiring. Maybe he is. I’ll believe it if he’s still out a decade from now. And even then, I won’t quite be convinced he’s staying out. Further, by that time, he might have had two or three successors at Ohio State. You don’t easily follow a legend. And even if Meyer does what he says he intends to, he is going to be the worst kind – a living legend who hangs around town. Those are just two of a number of viewpoints I have on this development and my alma mater’s nutty football program. After having spent more than five decades watching it, nothing surprises me anymore. Here are four opinions on today&#x27;s major news.<br/> Urban Meyer speaks during an introductory press conference as Bowling Green head coach exactly 18 years ago -- on Dec. 4, 2000. Meyer, who won three national championships and sparked controversy and criticism this season for his handling of domestic violence allegations against a now-fired assistant, will retire after the Rose Bowl, <i>AP/J.D. Pooley</i> <b>1. I don&#x27;t think Urban Meyer is finished, even if he doesn&#x27;t know it yet himself.</b> This man is 54 years old. He lives for coaching. Indeed, he might be addicted to it the way several I’ve known have been. If there is a way his health will allow him to continue, he will. If the arachnoid cyst symptoms from which Meyer suffers now prove treatable and his prognosis improves, I cannot believe he won’t be back again. That&#x27;s the thing. Give him time to recharge and refresh and Meyer won&#x27;t just want to come back, he&#x27;ll need to. He&#x27;s a sicko. I&#x27;ve known guys like this personally and they are beyond help unless the market keeps them out and they become un-hirable. That&#x27;s hardly the case with Meyer. He&#x27;s leaving on top. He will be felt out about any and every major job that comes open. Meyer announces his resignation at Florida on Dec. 9, 2010, citing health concerns. <i>AP/John Raoux</i> <b>2. This isn&#x27;t simply about his health. It&#x27;s also about getting suspended.</b> It could not have been clearer that Meyer did not believe he deserved to be suspended by OSU president Michael Drake during his sullen and oblique appearance at the school’s August press conference regarding the Zach Smith debacle. When asked specifically, he said his retirement was the “result of an accumulation of events.” When pressed about whether the Smith incident was one of those events, he said, “Sure.” Well, it wasn’t just about the stress it caused. It bred resentment. His prior hiatus at Florida wasn’t simply about health issues either, but also about a lack of respect he was shown by influential donors and alumni in the wake of a dysfunctional 2010 season and demands that he can then-OC Steve Addazio, later to be head coach at Temple and now Boston College. This, after he won UF two national titles. He wouldn’t capitulate. He simply ejected. Though he cited burnout at the time, he was right back in the saddle after a 1-year break. Ohio State NCAA college football head coach coach Urban Meyer, left, answers questions during a news conference announcing his retirement on Tuesday in Columbus, Ohio. At right is assistant coach Ryan Day. <i>AP/Jay LaPrete</i> <b>3. This is a very good day for Jim Harbaugh, James Franklin and Mark Dantonio.</b> You may have heard Meyer reference recruiting as a factor in making public his decision to retire now rather than after the Buckeyes’ Rose Bowl game against Washington. He said someone asked him: Wasn’t that way down the line of priorities? He responded that recruiting is everything in the business and that he wanted Ohio State to continue to succeed. Noble thought. And I suppose Ohio State can hope for its version of Lincoln Riley following seamlessly after Bob Stoops. But, to me, it smacks of wishful thinking. Outside of Nick Saban, nobody in the country has done the recruiting job of Meyer over the past seven seasons. That’s why his record has been 82-9 at Ohio State. That’s why he’s won three Big Ten titles and a national championship there. It’s the talent. And those elite players did not come just to play at Ohio State. They came to play for Urban Meyer. To gain access to his secret sauce so that they might earn a career in the NFL as so many of his players have at not just OSU but Florida, Utah and even Bowling Green. Will Ohio State still be a formidable recruiting foe for Michigan, Penn State and Michigan State in the Big Ten East? Certainly. But they all can hope to pick off a few more high-end recruits now than they did when Meyer was leading OSU’s shop. Playing for a 3-time national championship coach with a household name holds a little more cachet than some guy who’s been a successful coordinator. Ohio State NCAA college football offensive coordinator Ryan Day answers questions during a news conference announcing his hiring as head coach to replace Urban Meyer, who announced his retirement on Tuesday in Columbus. <i>AP/Jay LaPrete</i> <b>4. Ryan Day can&#x27;t be quite ready for this, no matter what a tactical wizard he is.</b> The job Day has done this season in overhauling Meyer’s stale spread-option and building an attack around the unique and dynamic passing skills of rookie starting quarterback Dwayne Haskins has been nothing short of heroic. He also took over the helm when Meyer was suspended the first three weeks. To me, he’s a no-brainer for the Broyles Award just handed to Alabama’s Mike Locksley as college football’s top assistant. That doesn’t mean he has any business being handed the position of Ohio State head coach. I don’t think he’s prepared for what he’s about to deal with. It’s much more than just a coaching job.",

      "full": "Alabama offensive coordinator Mike Locksley has agreed in principle to be Maryland’s next head football coach, according to multiple people close to the situation. Locksley, a Washington native, has twice worked as an assistant on the Terrapins&#x27; staff. He coached running backs from 1997 to 2002, and he returned as the offensive coordinator from 2012 to 2015. He served as interim head coach for the final six games of the 2015 season after Maryland fired Randy Edsall. When the school passed over Locksley for the permanent job in favor of DJ Durkin, Locksley headed to Alabama to be an offensive analyst. Locksley, 48, has helped lead Alabama&#x27;s offense to historic heights this season, his first calling plays for the Crimson Tide. Alabama (13-0) beat Georgia to win the SEC championship on Saturda and will return to the College Football Playoff as the top seed and defending national champion. Alabama&#x27;s offense averages 47.9 points per game (second nationally), 527.6 yards per game (seventh) and 7.92 yards per play (second). Alabama&#x27;s quarterback, Tua Tagovailoa, is a favorite to win the Heisman Trophy. Earlier on Tuesday, Locksley won the Broyles Award, which is given annually to the nation&#x27;s top assistant coach. &quot;Two years ago, I was in the Nick Saban witness protection program,&quot; Locksley said in his speech at the Broyles Award ceremony. &quot;I was out of a job. I just left the University of Maryland as the offensive coordinator, was kind of in between what I wanted to do. . . . What an honor and how great it&#x27;s been for me and my career to be able to rehabilitate it (at Alabama).&quot; Locksley is beloved in the D.C. football community and is known as a top recruiter of the area. Some of the players Locksley recruited to play at Maryland include wide receiver Stefon Diggs of the Minnesota Vikings and linebacker Jermaine Carter of the Carolina Panthers, both local products. Terms of Locksley&#x27;s contract with Maryland were not immediately available. Locksley inherits a Maryland program that has been overwhelmed with controversy and turmoil since the June death of 19-year-old offensive lineman Jordan McNair. McNair&#x27;s death led to two independent investigations, one that looked into the workout during which McNair suffered exertional heatstroke and another that examined the program&#x27;s culture. Since the summer, media reports outlined an abusive culture within the program and the external investigation found that problems festered because players feared speaking out. The investigation into the program found organizational dysfunction within the athletic department that could have contributed to the football program&#x27;s issues. Locksley&#x27;s only other head coaching job ended disastrously when he was fired midseason from New Mexico after accumulating a 2-26 record in just more than two seasons. Locksley also had off-the-field issues.",

Meyer says he&#x27;s been plagued with headaches and is dealing with the fallout of a domestic violence scandal that rocked his staff, but a lot of analysts believe he won&#x27;t stay unemployed for long. For many, Meyer&#x27;s legacy as one of the greatest college football coaches of all time is secure. Others judge him for the crimes that have occurred under his watch. What do you think? When it comes to coaching, it&#x27;s about what a man does on the field. And all Meyer has done is win. The Ohio native is a three-time national championship winner, including the first national champion under the current College Football Playoff system. His current .853 winning percentage ranks him third in NCAA history, and Meyer also has two Coach of the Decade awards to back that up. Meyer can&#x27;t track and control every human being he is in charge of. Other people&#x27;s transgressions should not taint his greatness. The legacy he built is intact. Part of being a coach is molding the men you&#x27;re charged with managing. Meyer&#x27;s track record has been terrible. He allegedly turned a blind eye to domestic violence at Ohio State. While he was at Florida, 31 players were arrested for misdemeanor and felony charges in the six years he was with the university. Regardless of whether or not he is at fault, an obvious pattern has emerged -- Meyer is not a good judge of character. Meyer didn&#x27;t do too many favors either with his &quot;apology&quot; to his former assistant coach&#x27;s ex-wife, where it took him a couple days to directly apologize to an alleged victim of domestic abuse.

Multiple news outlets reported the news on Tuesday morning, as the 54-year-old will coach the Buckeyes in the Rose Bowl and then move on to the next chapter of his life. The retirement is part due to ongoing health issues that Meyer has faced, including a brain cyst that he opened up about earlier this year.

Meyer was suspended for the first three games of the season after an investigation revealed that he mishandled domestic assault allegations made against former wide receivers coach Zach Smith, who was fired in late June. &quot;After returning to the sideline, Meyer fought through headaches and was visibly struggling during games, occasionally rubbing his head and bending over. He admitted during the season that a previously-revealed cyst on his brain was causing him problems but said that he was managing the pain and planned to coach next year.&quot;",

The Lebanon, Pa., native was a Maxwell Award winner in college and led the Lions to the Big Ten’s first 12-0 season after an 11-0 regular season in 1994 was capped by a Rose Bowl victory. His lengthy list of accolades included Penn State season records in a number of categories, some of which have been toppled by Trace McSorley since. Collins was also the Davey O’Brien Award winner as the quarterback of the year in 1994 and won the Chicago Tribune’s Silver Football as the top player in the Big Ten. Penn State was 40-9 during the quarterback’s time at the school. “To be inducted into the college football hall of fame is a honor and a total thrill. It’s an extremely awesome honor,” Collins said in an interview with the National Football Foundation. “What a thrill and what a privilege to be a part of this class.” Collins is the 25th former Penn State player or coach to be selected for the College Football Hall of Fame, and he goes in with a Class of 2018 that also includes: The Hall of Fame dinner will be streamed on WatchESPN on Tuesday night starting at 8:30 p.m. It can be viewed by clicking here.

Great competitor, has a lot of heart, plays with a lot of heart, played through injuries, and really has just grown and matured into an unbelievable leader,” Collins said. “Trace McSorley has had the best career at Penn State for any quarterback who’s ever played there.” Asked what he would say to the current team it awaits a Citrus Bowl matchup with Kentucky, Collins said: “I would tell them that, that uniform they put on, it means something. The helmet they put on, it means something. The way you play with that uniform on, it means something to a lot of people. There’s a long history of what Penn State is and what it’s all about, and it’s important to carry the tradition on, the values, what it stands for, and I think Coach Franklin and the squads he’s had recently are doing that.

And that’s why he will he officially inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame tomorrow night in New York along with 9 other players and 3 coaches in a ceremony held by the National Football Foundation at the Midtown Hilton. Collins was the consensus 1994 All-America quarterback, the Big Ten most valuable player and winner of the Maxwell, Sammy Baugh and Davey O&#x27;Brien awards. At the time it was posted, his 1994 passing efficiency of 172.9 placed him 3<sup>rd</sup> all-time for a single season, behind only Jim McMahon (1980) and Ty Detmer (1989), both of Brigham Young. Since then, more liberal air attacks and the rules changes that have fostered them have rewritten college passing records across the board. But his season 1994 season stats – 2,679 passing yards, .667 completion percentage and 10.1 yards per attempt – were, at the time, elite-level. Collins said that, though his pro career was more than four times longer, it’s his college years that he recalls more fondly: “I don’t know, the memories and the bond and the feelings are so much richer in college than they are in the pros. And I had some great moments in the pros, don’t get me wrong. Some great teammates and great teams. But those college years, those are the ones I really look back on. That’s when it was really special.” Ki-Jana Carter (32), Kerry Collins (12) and Kyle Brady (81) were all chosen in the first round of the 1995 NFL Draft. <i>Penn State Univ photo</i> There was nothing offensively that unbeaten 1994 Penn State team could not do. Not only did it deploy lethal weaponry at every skill position in feature back Ki-Jana Carter, tight end Kyle Brady and wideouts Bobby Engram and Freddie Scott, it possessed the most impressive array of blockers the program has ever had – fullbacks Brian Milne and Jon Witman lead blocking behind tackles Andre Johnson and Keith Conlin, guards Jeff Hartings and Marco Rivera and center Bucky Greeley. “You look at Hartings and Rivera, you’re talking future All-Pros. And those guys were a tight group. They did everything together. And they set a standard that, week in and week out, they were gonna be the best they could be. If we don’t have them, no way we could’ve had the year we had. They were what made us go.” Go, they did. Nobody stopped that offense. They averaged 47 points per game, tops in the nation, and scored ;30 against all 12 opponents. So, what was it like to direct that machine when it got revving? “The amount of talent on that team was absolutely ridiculous. We had backups who could’ve started for anyone else. A guy like Mike Archie had to play behind Ki-Jana. We were stacked. That recruiting class behind me [1992] has to be one of the best ever to come through Penn State.” Collins prepares to fire in his New York Giants&#x27; 41-0 rout of Minnesota Vikings in 2000 NFC championship game. <i>AP/Amy Sancetta</i> Even 24 years later, it&#x27;s impossible to talk to anyone on Penn State&#x27;s 1994 team without relating it to Nebraska&#x27;s voter-driven 1994 national champions. During an age when polls decided a mythical champ while bowls and conferences held power and commonly worked independently, the Cornhuskers were awarded the trophy by both major outlets – USA Today for the coaches and Associated Press for the writers. Big Ten champion and #2-ranked Penn State was forced to play Pac-10 champion Oregon; Big 12 champion and #1-ranked Nebraska played Big East champion Miami in the Orange Bowl. The two heavyweights never met. What might have happened, had they? “It would’ve been a great game,” said Collins. “Who knows, right? But it would’ve been nice to have a chance to play them.” I was asked recently by a reader where I’d rank Penn State’s quarterbacks through history in relation to current Nittany Lion leader Trace McSorley. Though that’s really a better question for the guys who played at the major-college level, I took the bait and replied that only three names from the past matter in my mind: Todd Blackledge, Michael Robinson and Collins. I went ahead and said that, because of his lengthy tenure compared to the others and his effect on the program in that span, I’d have to go with McSorley. Collins calls signals during 38-14 over Southern California in 1994. <i>Patriot-News/Peter Taylor</i> But I had to ask Collins what he thought of the 6-foot dual-threat as his PSU career draws to a close with the Citrus Bowl against Kentucky: “I’ve been really, really impressed with him. I’ll say this now: He’s had the best career of any quarterback at Penn State.” Including Collins himself? “One-hundred percent. Absolutely. He’s done it for what, three years now? I had one good year, maybe a third of another good year [1993]. “He’s won a bunch of games. Plus, he has a tremendous heart, just a great competitor.” Collins might have had the chance to start three years at Penn State himself were it not for an ill-placed injury before his sophomore season. Which leads to a story. Collins grew up in Lebanon before transferring to Wilson High in West Lawn where he finished out his high school career for the Bulldogs as something you don’t see that much of anymore – a 3-sport athlete (football, basketball, baseball). It was on to Penn State in 1991. And after Tony Sacca graduated, Collins was ticketed for the starting job as a soph in 1992. That’s when a broken finger suffered during the summer sidelined him for the first half of the season and forced Joe Paterno to play the backup, Tony’s younger brother John Sacca, for much of the year. Trace McSorley runs for yardage during the 27-26 loss to Ohio State, before which Kerry Collins was honored for his College Football Hall of Fame induction and the former and current PSU QBs briefly met. <i>PennLive/Joe Hermitt</i> It’s been a longstanding bit of lore among those around the Penn State program regarding exactly what fractured the index finger on Collins’ throwing hand. The rumors flew that it happened in some nighttime Lebanon scuffle, though that was never substantiated. All these years later, Collins vehemently insists that the cause was exactly what he told Paterno – a game of volleyball with his friends. Though he went along with it publicly for a decade and a half, Paterno scoffed at the story during a 2009 press conference. Which still bothers Collins to this day: “Joe was wrong. That was 100-percent true. But Joe never believed me. “I told him what happened. He looked at me and said, ‘Yeah. And I’m Knute Rockne.’ I said, ‘Joe, I’m telling you.’ But he just brushed it off, like I was lying through my teeth.” Imagining that scene all these years later, I couldn’t help laughing at the ridiculousness of it all. And Collins could appreciate the humor I found in the story. But even a quarter-century hasn’t affected his own viewpoint: “It pains me to know that Joe went to his grave not believing me. I guess no one ever did.” Anyway, the 1992 season had fizzled by the time Collins’ finger mended. And he never fully acquired the starting job until week 4 of 1993, the inaugural Big Ten slate. By the close of that year, a big 38-37 comeback win at Michigan State and a 31-13 rout of Heisman finalist Heath Shuler and Tennessee in the Citrus Bowl finally showed exactly what Collins and that blossoming offense were capable of. By the next year, everyone knew. Collins and Joe Paterno after the coach was drenched with Gatorade following the 38-20 win over Oregon in the Rose Bowl. <i>Patriot-News/Peter Taylor</i> Those stats are about longevity and durability. Which makes it all the more amazing that the only surgery Collins underwent in all that time was for a broken jaw in 1997 while he was with the Carolina Panthers, inflicted by notorious Denver Broncos linebacker Bill Romanowski: “He led with the crown of his helmet. He had a free shot and caught me perfectly underneath the chin. He did a number on me.” Romanowski was fined $25,000 even then. Now he would surely have been suspended. Collins rarely had such good fortune of playing with the same support in the NFL. He was drafted onto an expansion team in Charlotte in 1995, the fledgling Carolina Panthers. Though he soon after led them to a shocking NFC championship game appearance, he eventually was traded to the New Orleans Saints in 1998 and bounced around thereafter, the definition of an NFL journeyman. That&#x27;s one reason he will probably not add a bronze bust in the Pro Football Hall of Fame, though his 17-year NFL career spent with 6 clubs is impressive: Two All-Pro selections (1996, 2008); an electric 5-TD-pass performance in his New York Giants&#x27; 41-0 rout of the Minnesota Vikings in the 2000 NFC championship (that unfortunately led to a Super Bowl loss against the legendary Ravens defense); top-20 rankings all-time in both yardage (16<sup>th</sup>) and completions (11<sup>th</sup>). Panthers&#x27; quarterback Kerry Collins is hit by Broncos&#x27; linebacker Bill Romanowski during 1997 game in Denver. Speaking of quarterback abuse – what was allowed then and is prohibited now – I asked Collins what he thinks of the rules that so stringently protect QBs. His answer was surprising: “Oh my gosh. The whole thing of not being able to fall with full body weight onto a quarterback? That’s ridiculous. “It’s true. I mean, at some point, it’s gotta continue to be football, you know? “I guess a lot of guys from my era would probably say the same thing.” But then, a lot has changed. What about the college game? Would he have enjoyed the high-flying offensive explosions of today where dual-threats are valued oftentimes over pocket types? “I often wonder: Where would I have fit in in today’s game? There would’ve been only a handful of schools looking for a guy like me. I’m not running the RPO, right?” I responded: Neither is Ohio State’s Heisman finalist Dwayne Haskins, that there would be a place for someone like Collins, running empty with five wide. “True, but there’s fewer than 25 years ago. And to Joe’s credit, we tried to do some of that my senior year. But no, today’s such a more wide-open game. Truthfully, I enjoy watching [the current college game] a lot more than I enjoy the pros now.” Why? “When I look back to those college years, it was just such a pure time. The pros are the pros. It’s a business. Don’t let anybody fool you.” Collins looks to throw during 24-6 loss at Ohio State in 1993. <i>Getty/Rick Stewart</i> And so, it may be that Collins will treasure tomorrow night in Manhattan more than he might any hot July afternoon in Canton: “It’s a tremendous honor. I was the beneficiary of having an incredible amount of talent around me. I had as good a supporting cast almost anyone who’s ever played the game of college football. “It was the most selfless team I’ve ever been around. The hardest-working team I’ve ever been around. You wouldn’t know if it was a game on Saturday or a Tuesday practice with the speed we did things. That’s just the way we worked.” “If I go anywhere else but Penn State, I don’t think I go to the College Hall of Fame.” The rest of the class: PLAYERS: Trevor Cobb (RB, Rice, 1989-92); Dave Dickenson (QB, Montana, 1992-95); Dana Howard (LB, Illinois, 1991-94); Calvin Johnson (WR, Georgia Tech, 2004-06); Paul Palmer (RB, Temple, 1983-86); Ed Reed (DB, Miami, 1998-2001), Matt Stinchcomb (OT, Georgia, 1995-98); Aaron Taylor (OL, Nebraska, 1994-97); and Charles Woodson (DB, Michigan, 1995-97). COACHES: Frank Beamer (Murray State, 1981-86; Virginia Tech, 1987-2015); Mack Brown (Appalachian State, 1983; Tulane, 1985-87; North Carolina, 1988-97, 2018-current); Texas, 1998-2013); Mel Tjeerdsma (Austin-TX College, 1984-93; Northwest Missouri State (1994-2010).

      "full": "Sunday was a busy day for Penn State coach James Franklin. It started with a staff and team meetings at 7 a.m. and 9 a.m., respectively. Practice came next, and then a quick goodbye to five-star defensive end and official visitor Nolan Smith was followed by the fifth-year head coach hustling to the airport to catch a flight to New Jersey. In the Garden State, Franklin had a home visit with longtime quarterback commit and Class of 2019 four-star Taquan Roberson, and it was there that he learned the No. 12 Lions are going take on No. 14 Kentucky in the Jan. 1 Citrus Bowl. “The coaches have been on the road recruiting, the players got some time off to focus on academics, and then we got back together today and had a really good, spirited practice,” Franklin said on a bowl conference call. “Important time for us to get going. The time off was important. It’s a long season. The time off is needed and warranted, but our guys are excited about getting to play another game.” Kentucky, which is coached by Mark Stoops, is 9-3 and has wins over three teams in the final College Football Playoff top-25. Franklin was not ready to discuss the SEC foe’s personnel quite yet, but the Lions will certainly be challenged by star back Benny Snell (1,305 rushing yards, 14 touchdowns) and end/linebacker Josh Allen (84 tackles, 14 sacks) on game day, which is scheduled for 1 p.m. on New Year’s Day in Orlando, Fla. Franklin was ready to discuss the College Football Playoff, though, saying that he was hopeful but not surprised when the Lions were left out of a New Year’s Six Bowl, but he did discuss what may need to happen moving forward now that the conference has been left out of the Playoff three years in a row. “As a conference, we have to look at what we’re doing, look at our model, and see if it makes sense, especially our side of the conference,” Franklin said. “We’re beating each other up week in and week out. Other conferences play eight [conference] games and there’s conversation of putting two of their teams in, and we play nine and have been left out three years in a row. Are we doing what’s best for our conference schools to make the Playoff? “In my mind, that’s what you need to do. You need to do everything in your power to give you the best chance to be undefeated at the end of the regular season. It’s at least worth a discussion, because it’s three years in a row now that we’ve been left out.” The eight-game conference schedule and two-team part of his comment were in reference to the SEC and the fact that Georgia was a potential Playoff candidate along with Alabama, even though the No. 1 Crimson Tide were ultimately the only team to make it from that conference. “We have to look at that as well, and say, are we putting our programs in the Big Ten in the best position to compete for a national championship?” Franklin said. “When one conference who is playing less conference games than we are and has been playing I-AA programs for a long time, when there’s discussion of them possibly getting two teams in and us having been left out the last three years, it doesn’t make a whole lot of sense to not at least have the conversation.” It won’t change anything this year, though, as the Lions will slowly work in to their bowl season practice schedule while the coaches continue to recruit and the players finish out the academic semester with finals next week. Franklin had two more in-home visits to do Sunday night, and the players will be in the weight room this week while the coaches continue traveling to see top high school talent all over the country. “The players are really excited, the coaches are really excited, it’s a historic bowl game, and we’re looking forward to playing Kentucky,” Franklin said. &quot;I’ve been a head coach in the SEC and very familiar with coach, and I think it’s going to be a great game and a tremendous challenge.

Allen, who wears No. 41, is finalist for a slew of major awards after racking up 18.5 tackles for loss and 14 sacks. Allen is in contention to win the Bednark Award (outstanding defensive player), the Bronko Nagurski Trophy (top defensive player) and the Butkus Award (top linebacker). Allen is also one of five finalists for the Walter Camp Football Foundation Player of the Year award. He is the only defensive player in contention for the award. Allen, who is a possible top-10 pick in the 2019 NFL draft, has accepted an invitation to play in the prestigious Senior Bowl. The Kentucky offense is led by running back Benny Snell and dual-threat quarterback Terry Wilson. The 5-11, 223-pound Snell ran for 1,305 yards and scored 14 touchdowns during the regular season. He had a 175-yard rushing effort vs. Florida and gouged Mississippi State for 165 yards and four touchdowns.

Joe Hermitt | jhermitt@pennlive.com Welcome to the final PennLive Penn State mailbag of 2018. It&#x27;s hard to imagine just how quickly the regular season flew by, as the Lions finished 9-3 to earn a Citrus Bowl date opposite Kentucky, let alone the rest of the year that came before it. Dating all the way back to January, Penn State finished with a top-10 recruiting Class of 2018, picked up a handful of verbal commitments before spring practice, and then rolled into summer camp knowing that many old faces would need to be replaced and many new names would have to fill the stat sheet. Ultimately, James Franklin&#x27;s fifth season with the Lions played out just as most thought it would, and now they are spending Day 2 in Orlando, Fla., ahead of their Jan. 1 postseason matchup that will offer a chance to win 10 or more games for the third year in a row. At any rate, we&#x27;ll do plenty of looking ahead while also reminiscing about some of the highs and lows from the year that was in this week&#x27;s mailbag, and thanks as always for all of your questions and comments over the last 360 days or so to keep this piece moving. This week, we discus: And much more. Let&#x27;s get to it. <b>@porakapooloza asks: </b> Are current players allowed to contact recruits during ‘dead periods’? The NCAA does not have terribly clear rules when it comes to player contact with recruits. It&#x27;s a bit of a grey area, but previously, it hasn&#x27;t really been kosher for current players to contact recruits when they are not on campus. That said, we see it on social media all the time, and so it almost feels as if the NCAA figures it cannot properly police it and thus lets most of it slide. As for coaches, they are allowed to have electronic communication with players during a dead period, but Class of 2020 players must initiate that contact. It&#x27;s a lot of direct messages and texts this time of year. <b>@MJtheHef asks</b> What’s the cliff notes version of how many players need to declare early / leave this summer to make our scholarship numbers work given current and expected/hopeful signings in Feb? Penn State head coach James Franklin, center, makes his way onto the field with captains Blake Gillikin, Nick Scott, Koa Farmer and Trace McSorley on Sept. 14, 2018. Joe Hermitt | jhermitt@pennlive.com As always, the numbers are murky because decisions have not been publicly announced and scholarships given to walk-ons are not guaranteed year-over-year in all cases, though in some cases they are rolled over. Then there&#x27;s the trickiness of tracking scholarship numbers when the program doesn&#x27;t release them, which makes our count unofficial. That disclaimer out of the way, it looks to me like the Lions will need to lose at least three or four players to sign two or three more, based on the current projected allotment. Put another way, if the Lions lose one or two players to the NFL and then see a couple of guys decide to transfer, give up football, and so on, they will be fine, and the fact that most college programs lost a handful of players each offseason signals that the numbers will work themselves out in 2019. <b>@Chris_B_Israel asks: </b> Which of the early signees is PSU&#x27;s biggest get? Not so much in terms of talent, but filling their biggest need? Brandon Smith, a 5-star linebacker from Louisa County High School in Mineral, Va., signs his letter of intent to attend Penn State on Dec 19, 2018. Joe Hermitt | jhermitt@pennlive.com <b>@realhuntdog23 asks: </b> Using your crystal ball, what incoming 2019 recruits do you see having the most immediate on-field impact? Since we answered the early enrollee question above, let&#x27;s stick to the guys who will not show up on campus in January. That list of seven players includes: DT Hakeem Beamon S Jaquan Brisker WR John Dunmore RB Devyn Ford CB Joey Porter Jr. OL Caedan Wallace OL Saleem Wormley It&#x27;s difficult for lineman to play right away, so we&#x27;ll throw Wormley, Wallace, and Beamon out at the jump. It&#x27;s tempting to pick Joey Porter Jr., here, as his length (6-1, 185) might make him an early rotation contributor, and also Dunmore, who has the speed and size to work his way into the rotation. The selection is Brisker, however, as the Lions are again looking to replace a starting safety with Nick Scott set to depart, and while the Lackawanna College transfer might not start over the players already filling the depth chart like Lamont Wade, Ayron Monroe, and some others, his tape certainly indicates that he&#x27;s ready-made to make an impact right away. The list of January enrollees stands at 11, and includes: RB Noah Cain, LB Lance Dixon, CB Keaton Ellis, DE Adisa Isaac, QBs Michael Johnson Jr. and Ta’Quan Roberson, CB Tyler Rudolph, LB Brandon Smith, TE Brenton Strange, OL Anthony Whigan and CB Marquis Wilson. Whigan could find himself in a strong battle for a starting job if Connor McGovern decides to leave, but if he does not, the Lions are set to return all five starting linemen next season, which means he&#x27;ll have an uphill climb for playing time. That leaves us with Smith, who is the easy pick but also the class&#x27; lone five-star, and with the Lions needing to replace Koa Farmer heading into next season, Smith is as good an option as any to jump in and make an early impact. <b>@JohnJoh17205634 asks: </b> Are there any off the radar 2019 targets that PSU is still targeting, who many fans wouldn&#x27;t be aware of? Most of Penn State&#x27;s targets heading into the February signing day are well known at this point, but the one who has come onto the radar in recent weeks is West Virginia four-star lineman Doug Nester. He passed on signing with Ohio State, which he is currently committed to, so that he could let the process play out as Ryan Day readies to take over in Columbus and maybe make some staff changes. Outside of him, New Jersey three-star end Smith Vilbert was not talked about much during the fall but has blown up in the last month and a half, and Penn State is now battling a number of power FBS schools for his signature. <b>@Nittany1982 asks: </b> Looking at next year&#x27;s schedule, the first 4 games look very winnable. There is 1 open date then Purdue at Beaver Stadium. Will that game be a test? The games after that include a improving Minnesota then our 3 thorns. What do you think ? Purdue head coach Jeff Brohm, right, and wide receivers coach and co-offensive coordinator JaMarcus Shephard get set to scrimmage the offense and defense during NCAA football practice Friday, Aug. 10, 2018, in West Lafayette, Ind. (John Terhune/Journal & Courier via AP) We&#x27;ll do a way-too-early prediction later on in this piece, but let&#x27;s start with a teaser look at the September schedule. Penn State opens up its 2019 slate with Idaho and Buffalo, which should be sound wins, and then the Lions face Pittsburgh to close out the school&#x27;s four-year series in Week 3. The Lions pasted the Panthers the last time the two sides met at Beaver Stadium, and then won handily at Heinz Field last year. We&#x27;ll mark this as a win for now. Next, the Lions open Big Ten play at Maryland, which will potentially be a test, as new coach Mike Locksley is sure to bring a fired up team out for that home date. Purdue will bring Jeff Brohm&#x27;s high-flying offense to Beaver Stadium then, and the secondary will get a stiff test against returning passer David Blough and star receiver Rondale Moore. PSU should win both, however, and they&#x27;ll be favored to do so, but is it a nice early slate to get a feel for things as compared to previous years. <b>@corbinwood57 asks: </b> Do think we have a good chance at landing Fleming in this up coming 2020 class? Southern Columbia&#x27;s Julian Fleming stiff arms Wilmington&#x27;s Danny Hanssen in their PIAA Class AA title game at Hersheypark Stadium. December 07, 2018 Sean Simmers | ssimmers@pennlive.com PENNLIVE.COM Yes, Penn State has a very good chance to land the Southern Columbia star junior and five-star receiver. He just released a top-10 on Tuesday that included the Lions and a number of other heavy hitters, but he&#x27;s made it a habit to visit State College and PSU more than any other school, and that will go a long way in the Lions&#x27; pursuit to get him. Ohio State will be a factor, as well, but it would be a surprise if Penn State does not win out in the end for the nation&#x27;s No. 5 Class of 2020 recruit according to the 247Sports&#x27; Composite rankings. <b>@WooGirrl asks: </b> What happens when a player like Sanders declares for the draft - does he leave campus immediately (bags packed and no free meals?). Strange question but I’ve wondered this since Barkley declared. It depends. Some guys will elect to leave early but have Penn State&#x27;s strength and conditioning staff train them for the NFL Combine and Draft, so they&#x27;ll stay in town and live off-campus somewhere. Agents typically help out with any financial needs in that regard fully knowing they&#x27;re going to get a return on their investment sometime in the future. Other players, like Barkley, will have plans to train at different facilities around the country, and they&#x27;ll ship out pretty much immediately to get to work before the various January all-star games carry them into the Combine and then Pro Day and private workouts before the Draft. <b>@Mikeczyzewski asks: </b> How do the new redshirt rules apply to JUCO recruits? Can Whigan and/or Brisker play up to 4 games in 2019 and still redshirt and play in ‘20 and ‘21? It&#x27;s a good question. The answer depends on whether or not they redshirted during their time at the junior college. Brisker and Whigan both logged snaps in both seasons at Lackawanna, and so it stands to reason that each will have three seasons to play two at Penn State, which means a four-game redshirt would be in play. We&#x27;ll circle back with a firm answer as soon as possible. <b>@joe_lloyd11 asks: </b> When does the team head to Orlando and what’s the general schedule? Penn State head coach James Franklin during practice at Holuba Hall on Dec. 14, 2018. Joe Hermitt | jhermitt@pennlive.com Penn State&#x27;s charter flight was wheels up from Pennsylvania with a final destination of Orlando on Wednesday morning.

The Warminster, Pa., Archbishop Wood grad and Penn State redshirt junior grew up rooting for the Eagles, and so while Penn State is here to focus on Kentucky and enjoy other Citrus Bowl events, head coach James Franklin has made sure to balance work and fun, and Bates will use some of his down time to root for a Philadelphia win and a Minnesota loss so that his childhood favorite makes the NFL Playoffs. “I’ll always be an Eagles fan,” Bates said outside of Orlando’s ‘Main Event Entertainment&#x27; where Penn State spent some time playing arcade games, bowling, and eating on Saturday night. Think of it as a Dave & Busters equivalent. “Big Eagles fan.” The opportunity to watch the game is a convenient segue into the mind of the 6-foot-4, 302-pound tackle/guard, because he watches the game differently than the regular fan does. That probably comes as no surprise, and in fact, it’s almost a cliche, but what exactly does a top college football lineman focus on when viewing games on television? &quot;I’ve always watched Jason Peters play, Lane Johnson, Jason Kelce; the people who play the position I play, because I want to see what other people are doing, what techniques they’re doing,&quot; Bates said.",

      "full": "BY GREG PICKEL | gpickel@pennlive.com Penn State head coach James Franklin during practice on Oct. 10, 2018. Joe Hermitt | jhermitt@pennlive.com It’s the season of giving, and that got us thinking: What might the Penn State football program have on its wish list this year? The topics could start and go in any number of directions, as every college team across the country desires for more of this, that, or the other thing as they all fight for bigger and better facilities, the best roster possible, a long list of established and highly-regarded assistant coaches, and more. Here’s the five that come immediately to the top of our mind this year for James Franklin’s program. <b>All the juniors return</b> Penn State running back Miles Sanders meets the press during Citrus Bowl media day on Dec. 14, 2018. Joe Hermitt | jhermitt@pennlive.com Penn State is going to have to lose a few players in the new year, as its 18 signees and current list of defections between seniors and those deciding to transfer and/or end their football career early appears to have the school slightly over the 85-man scholarship limit mandated by the NCAA. That’s an unofficial number, though, and we know for a fact that the program knows exactly where it stands internally. All that said, typical attrition which happens each and every offseason at most schools across the FBS landscape, should take care of any overages, and the Lions should wish for their impact juniors to come back because of it. “I would say things will shake themselves out here,” director of player personnel Andy Frank said on Wednesday. “You&#x27;ll have some NFL guys that will consider that and some may do it. You may potentially have some guys that transfer. That&#x27;ll kind of start to set where those numbers are at. We have some feels on some of those things.” The three to watch closest in this regard are end Shareef Miller, back Miles Sanders, and offensive lineman Connor McGovern. All three have said they won’t decide until after the bowl game, but each seems to be taking the process seriously. If we’re guessing, two of those three will move on, and then there’s punter Blake Gillikin and receiver Juwan Johnson, who have every reason to come back and yet could sniff around the NFL or grad transfer markets, as well, if they so desire. We’ll see if PSU received this gift by the second week of January. <b>Recruits sign in February </b> Penn State football head coach James Franklin holds National Signing Day at the school&#x27;s Lasch Building, December 19, 2018. Dan Gleiter | dgleiter@pennlive.com Penn State still has some work to do on the recruiting trail, as even though 18 freshmen-to-be are in, room exists for a few more signees. Keep in mind that space is tight (the program is using the phrase wiggle room) and fluid, but the program is always going to take as many high-priority recruits as it can, and the board still has some options on it. “There are some guys, like Coach [Franklin] said, that we feel strongly that we have a really good chance at getting,” Frank said. “There are others that are somewhere in between. And there&#x27;s probably another group of kids that we&#x27;ll see where the national board is at right now and who didn&#x27;t sign and who might be an option for us moving forward. “We may or may not have been recruiting them all the way through the process but if we think they are someone that can play for us, we&#x27;ll start that process and see what happens.” On offense, the list is headlined by Ohio State commit Doug Nester, a four-star offensive lineman from West Virginia who passed on signing with the Buckeyes during the early window because he wanted to see what soon-to-be head coach Ryan Day did with the OSU staff once Urban Meyer retires after the Rose Bowl. He visited Penn State earlier this month, and the Lions continue to be in play to flip him. Besides Nester, Penn State is likely to pursue a few new names between now and February, which means they could take another look at unoffered prospects or dive back in on offered ones who did not sign. Defensively, PSU’s intentions are clear: They want to get another defensive lineman or two, and the three potential candidates that immediately come to mind are three-star New York DT Jared Harrison-Hunte, four-star Maryland defensive tackle D’Von Ellies, and three-star New Jersey end Smith Vilbert. Another prospect, Florida four-star athlete Mark-Anthony Richards, has the Lions in his top-group along with Auburn and Miami. Penn State could successfully cross this item off its wish list if it can land at least half the names listed above by the time the first Wednesday in February arrives. <b>Keep the staff together</b> Penn State head coach James Franklin poses with his coaching staff during the team&#x27;s photo day at Beaver Stadium on Aug. 18, 2018. Joe Hermitt | jhermitt@pennlive.com Last year at this time, Penn State was going into bowl preparations with a few new faces on its coaching staff, and more would come after the Lions battled Washington in the Fiesta Bowl. This year, that isn’t the case. At least, it isn’t yet. Don’t be fooled into thinking that can’t change, though, as coaches will now begin a new wave of firing assistants while schools searching for new head coaches will be able to expand their pool of candidates now that Signing Day has come and gone. Connecticut made sweeping changes on Friday, as did Navy, and more are likely to come. It’s not necessarily right to fire coaches after recruits signed to play for them, but it’s an accepted part of college football. On top of that, we’re not saying that any of Penn State’s coaches are looking for another job, and it’s possible they couldn’t find one even if they wanted to, but staff attrition is fairly common anymore, and so while losing a coach or two each year isn’t ideal, it is also a real possibility. Here’s Franklin’s specific wish in that regard. “I think consistency is important,” he said, “but I also understand that we&#x27;re at a point in our profession and in this game where that&#x27;s challenging. <br/> &quot;There&#x27;s also going to be opportunities that come that I want for our guys. I think you guys have heard me say this before. I think guys have a chance to be head coaches, and guys have a chance to be play calling coordinators, very specifically play calling coordinators, I want that for them. I want that for them.<br/> <br/> &quot;But we can&#x27;t lose guys for lateral moves. That cannot happen with the type of program that we have and for the type of program we want to be. That&#x27;s critical. That&#x27;s critical.&quot; Put another way: Franklin still isn’t thrilled about Josh Gattis leaving for Alabama. To sum it all up, breaking in new coaches is hard. It takes time, players lose familiarity, and progress is set back some or halted in some way, which is exactly why this topic is front and center on our hypothetical wish list. “Obviously I don&#x27;t want turnover,” Franklin said. “I want to try to keep as much consistency here as we possibly can. But I think those guys did a really good job and Andy Frank and the whole recruiting department helps -- helps with that, as well, so when these guys show up and we try to figure out what their recruiting area is going to be -- because that&#x27;s another thing.” <b>Facilities upgrades</b> Penn State head coach James Franklin directs a drill during practice at Holuba Hall on Dec. 14, 2018. Joe Hermitt | jhermitt@pennlive.com Penn State’s football program has nice facilities. The recently renovated locker room has wowed players and recruits (plus their families) alike, and some fresh paint and turf at Holuba Hall and for the outdoor practice fields has brightened the place up a bit. There’s a new academic center near the Lasch Building that appears to be top of the line from the outside, and some work has been done in the main football building lobby, and also in some other parts of the building, to bring it up to modern expectations. All that said, an enormous amount of work still needs to be done. &quot;We have parts of our facility where the carpets haven&#x27;t been changed in 20 years,&quot; Franklin said last May, according to the Centre Daily Times. &quot;The hard part is, we&#x27;re trying to play catch up for a 10-year period of time where we didn&#x27;t really do a whole lot. And it&#x27;s not like everybody is pressing the pause button and waiting for us to catch up. They still have the foot on the gas driving forward.&quot; Work can only be done as money comes in, and while some projects have hit fundraising goals and/or were taken care of as part of the planned budget, other projects must wait for the money to complete them, and that can be a difficult balance of waiting while not pushing donors while also realizing that things need to get done as quickly as possible. This isn’t to suggest Penn State’s facilities are bad, falling apart, or anything of the like. Recruits frequently pinpoint the stadium and football buildings as highlights of their trip to campus. That said, in the age of built-in water slides and other wild amenities, the Lions are certainly behind the times. They’ll never go that length, most imagine, but more flash is always good, and then, there’s that big Beaver Stadium renovation coming at some point, too. It’s listed No. 4 here but may be No. 1 in the end. <b>Health and happiness</b> Penn State head coach James Franklin addresses the team during practice on Sept. 26, 2018. Joe Hermitt | jhermitt@pennlive.com We’ll end our wish list (again, this could go on: Leave your entries in the comments) with what just about anyone would like this time of year.",

It only matters that the numbers exist. Because then they can be studied and parsed and cross-referenced and quoted and discussed. At length. I am as guilty as anyone in quoting one of the lists – the 247 Sports composite that annually ranks the schools’ recruiting classes. It’s easy, it’s relevant in that talent generally drives success. And the rankings are more accurate than they used to be now that the top national players do occasionally meet and compete during off-season camps. That doesn’t mean I can get as excited as the geeks over something like a highly rated quarterback deciding to transfer. Then, you’re referencing an individual ranking that may or may not be legitimate. History shows they aren’t all that often. For instance, I don’t know that I’ve ever seen the explosion of excitement that I did this week when Georgia QB Justin Fields made it known he was looking for a new school. It was as if Patrick Mahomes just became available. Fields has proven nothing at the college level. He was beaten out for the Georgia QB job in his freshman season by sophomore incumbent Jake Fromm, even though Kirby Smart gave him every opportunity to take it. Yet, it’s as if the geeks are certain he will singlehandedly turn around any program at which he lands. Y’know, he was the #1-ranked overall recruit in last year’s class! But transferring is becoming an epidemic these days. It’s not that I blame kids who do it. In order to have a chance at a multimillion-dollar NFL career, you have to get playing time in college. And if you can’t get it one place, you try another. I’m just mystified that so many people seem so convinced that rankings equal success. They just don’t necessarily at all. Especially highly-ranked quarterbacks who transfer. History proves it. I recently saw tweeted a graphic of such QBs who’ve switched schools in the past eight years. Including Fields, there are now 10 quarterbacks ranked either #1 or #2 nationally at their position coming out of high school by the 247 Sports composite who have transferred colleges. Their results have been spotty at best. The more you sift through this list, the more you realize how flimsy is the ranking: • Phillip Sims (#1 in 2010), of the Tidewater region of Virginia, got beat out by A.J. McCarron at Alabama, played a season at Virginia, flunked out and ended up at Winston-Salem State. He went undrafted and was cut from two NFL teams without playing a down. • Jeff Driskell (#1 in 2011) had a decent season as the starter at Florida in 2012, lost his job in 2013, split time in 2014 and threw for 9 TDs and 10 interceptions and fled for Louisiana Tech where he had a big year in 2015. He is the star of this entire group, having been claimed off waivers by the Cincinnati Bengals as a back-up. He has been starting for injured Andy Dalton as the Bengals play out the string of 2018.",

      "full": "PHILADELPHIA — Like most coaches, Bill O’Brien has led a bit of a nomadic life, with seven stops connecting the beginning of his coaching career as an assistant at Brown in the early 1990s to his current status as Houston Texans head coach 25 years later. In between, there were stints at Georgia Tech, Maryland and Duke in college and a couple years with the New England Patriots where he rose to prominence as Tom Brady’s quarterbacks coach and offensive coordinator. But while O’Brien has been coaching the Texans since 2014, he might be most known for the other stop on his career: His two seasons at Penn State in 2012 and 2013. O’Brien returns to Pennsylvania as a head coach for the second time in his career and first time since 2014 on Sunday when his Texans face off with the Philadelphia Eagles at Lincoln Financial Field in Week 16 showdown. “Love Penn State,” O’Brien said Tuesday during a teleconference with Philadelphia media. “My experience at Penn State, my family&#x27;s experience there was great. Still have a lot of friends that live there. We made a lot of great, special friends there and follow them as much as we can.” O’Brien’s tenure with the Nittany Lions served as a bridge between the end of the Joe Paterno era and the heights achieved by the program under current coach James Franklin. Under O’Brien, Penn State never bottomed out despite the heavy sanctions leveled on the program by the NCAA in the aftermath of the Jerry Sandusky scandal. In O’Brien’s first season in State College, Penn State went 8-4, including a victory over then-No. 24 Northwestern. He stayed on with the program despite interviewing for NFL head coaching vacancies after that season. His first — and only — full recruiting class featured five-star quarterback Christian Hackenberg, four-star tight end Adam Breneman and a handful of other recruits who would become contributors for the Lions, including Brendan Mahon, Andrew Nelson, DaeSean Hamilton and Garrett Sickels. Penn State went 7-5 in O’Brien’s second season, and then he was off to the NFL, where’s found some success. He has only one losing season in five years, and he hit double-digit wins for the first time this season. The Texans had a nine-game winning streak earlier this season and are in the driver’s seat in the AFC South. Houston has one of the game’s entertaining young players in quarterback Deshaun Watson, and there’s a significant amount of star power on both sides of the ball, including J.J. Watt, DeAndre Hopkins, Jadeveon Clowney, Lamar Miller and more. Now, O’Brien returns to the turf where he spent a brief period of his coaching career. But it’s a place where he had a deep impact, and one he remembers fondly. “It&#x27;s a fantastic place,” O’Brien said. “It&#x27;s great to see them having the success that they&#x27;re having now. Penn State&#x27;s a special place.” Philadelphia Eagles on PennLive",

There is no question that the Lions have the quarterback edge, as Trace McSorley will play the final game of his illustrious career in blue and white opposite Kentucky signal caller Terry Wilson Jr., but this one will be won in the trenches, and offensive coordinator Eddie Gran is aware of which PSU unit his team must neutralize. “Their front is how they operate,” Gran said. “They’re the real deal. The front makes them go. Those front four guys are really good, and they have some backups come in who are really productive.” That said, the third-year Kentucky staffer also realizes that his team must deal with more than just a Lions pass rush that has the most sacks in the Big Ten. “Amani [Oruwariye] I think is a heck of a player, Micah Parsons, he’s productive as heck, and he’s a guy that just shows up, and Coach [Brent] Pry does a great job,” Gran added. “They’re fundamentally sound. We’re going to have to deal with the front. They’re real.” Penn State cornerback Amani Oruwariye carries the American flag before the Iowa game on Oct. 27, 2018. Joe Hermitt | jhermitt@pennlive.com <b>Wildcats dialed in on McSorley</b> A month off before the bowl game certainly allowed Trace McSorley to get healthy. It also gave the Wildcats plenty of time to game plan for No. 9. What are they most worried about? “When he starts to scramble, he can throw the ball effectively down the field,” star Kentucky end/linebacker Josh Allen said. “He knows how to get out of the pocket. We have to do a good job containing the rush and get home.” Penn State quarterback Trace McSorley answers a question during a Citrus Bowl press conference on Dec. 29, 2018. Joe Hermitt | jhermitt@pennlive.com Added defensive coordinator Matt House: “A winner. A guy that just consistently finds a way to win. He prolongs downs, he can throw the ball vertically down the field, he can hurt you with his feet, but more than anything, I think he’s just a winner.” There&#x27;s no arguing that, as McSorley will start his 40<sup>th</sup> career game in the Citrus Bowl and can win his 32<sup>nd</sup> contest in blue and white with a victory on Tuesday. His first passing attempt will also make him the first quarterback in Penn State history to throw a pass in four bowl games. “It’s been an honor to coach a kid who gives everything he’s got every day,” Penn State offensive coordinator Ricky Rahne said. “Whether you’re in March and your meeting, or whether it’s preseason practice and a 7v7 drill, whatever it is, he’s giving his maximum effort and attention to detail. That’s a rare thing.”",

Smith, all 6-5 and 228 pounds of him, wore salmon-colored pants, a blue PSU pullover, a blue Penn State bowtie and a blue PSU baseball cap. Smith was seated at a small table inside the Louisa County High School cafeteria. Now his signing day news conference was complete with his decision to play for James Franklin’s Nittany Lions. Seated at the table around Brandon was his grandfather, Matt, father Rico, mom Cynthia and younger brother Jordan. Standing behind Brandon was Louisa County football coach Will Patrick, and off to the side stood athletic director George Stanley, who played defensive line at Virginia a while back. A small gathering of friends and family looked on as Brandon Smith, considered by some to be the top inside linebacker prospect in the country, had made it official. It was a big day for Penn State football and an even bigger day for the Smith family and Louisa County football. The Lions locked down their only five-star recruit in the 2019 class and Brandon’s parents were ecstatic that he followed through on his Penn State decision. From the early stages, Penn State was the only choice Rico, Cynthia and Brandon really considered after visiting with Franklin and defensive coordinator Brent Pry a couple of times in State College.",

So you know, for us, we want to build strong relationships with parents, with high school coaches, with prospects, try to get them to jump on board early, and then, you know, not waiver, because they are very comfortable with their decision. “For the most part, that’s how things go for us when you look nationally, how -- how those things usually go and how it usually goes for us. We usually stick to that plan. We usually don’t have a whole lot of drama. I think when you get older, you want to eliminate as much drama from your life as possible and that’s what we try to do even in recruiting.” The class was headlined by five-star Virginia linebacker Brandon Smith, four-star running back Devyn Ford, four-star guard Caedan Wallace, and a couple of junior college signees in Anthony Whigan, a tackle, and Jaquan Brisker, a corner. Monday’s commitment from four-star end Adisa Isaac provided a nice punch heading into the big day, as well, and in the end, the class is made up of prospects from 11 different states, which was a highlight for the program after years of mostly strictly regional recruiting. It’s an extra boon that 11 of the 18 signees will enroll for classes when the winter semester begins at University Park on Jan. 7, which will give them a leg up on the field and in the classroom. “I’m also proud of the fact that since we’ve arrived, we’ve been able to continue to broaden our reach,” Franklin said. &quot;You think about Oregon (quarterback Michael Johnson Jr.), you think about Florida (Dunmore and Cain), it looks good today, on paper, and I think it will end up looking good on the field, as well. I don’t know if I necessarily felt that way when we were flying all over the country multiple states per day. “At the end of the day, I thought our staff did a great job of identifying high, high-character kids that want to come to a great institution like Penn State and compete in the classroom and compete on the football field and keep chipping away at where we’re going.

The iconic hero played by Mark Hamill took the entirety of 2015’s “Star Wars: The Force Awakens” to appear, alone on a godforsaken rock on a distant planet, cloaked and hooded, bearded and scowling, his eyes glassy. That was the cliffhanger of the movie, and even without uttering a single word, Luke seemed to be hanging on by a pinky finger. Now, in &quot;The Last Jedi,&quot; we revisit that scene. Luke&#x27;s confronted by Rey (Daisy Ridley), the heroine of this new trilogy in the beloved franchise. She&#x27;s fresh of face, eager and curious, and troubled by a past she either doesn&#x27;t remember or doesn&#x27;t want to acknowledge. His face is weary and haggard, weathered by tragedy. He&#x27;s still a Jedi warrior and guru, and still strong in the Force, that ethereal power that binds the universe and its denizens in a well-balanced web of good and evil. But he&#x27;s reluctant to explore why the Force, you know, awakened in Rey, because his previous student, once known as Ben Solo, now Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), was his great failure, the Jedi who turned evil and reignited the galaxy&#x27;s fascist power. Mark Hamill as Luke Skywalker in &quot;Star Wars: The Last Jedi.&quot; (John Wilson | Photo provided to MLive.com by Disney/Lucasfilm) You might toss and turn a fair bit about that, too. Not coincidentally, Kylo Ren hasn’t been sleeping well either. You’ll recall from the previous movie, he killed his own father, Han Solo, terminating Harrison Ford’s movie contract with a lightsaber. He also lost a fight to a lightsaber novice, Rey, which has his boss, the gnarled CGI creep Snoke (Andy Serkis, in one of his many motion-capture performances), on his case. Snoke thought he had a new Darth Vader, but the brash Kylo – Vader’s grandson, if you’re not familiar with “Star Wars” space opera lineage – shows many signs of weakness in the Dark Side of the Force. Adam Driver as Kylo Ren in &quot;Star Wars: The Last Jedi.&quot; (Photo provided to MLive.com by Disney/Lucasfilm) And now, something strange is happening between Kylo and Rey, who can communicate across light years with some type of Force Face Time, each trying to beckon the other towards their side. She’s open, and a little secretive. He’s secretive, and a little open. That’s the Light Side and the Dark Side of the Force right there in a nutshell for you.",

Add matzo meal, eggs, oil or margarine (or whatever fat you’re using), water, salt and pepper. Stir to combine. Refrigerate for about 1 hour. Fill a large pot with water and bring to a boil. Moisten palms with cold water. Form the mixture into balls, about 1” in diameter. Drop matzo balls into boiling water. When all the matzo balls are in the pot, reduce heat to low.

Over 200 friends, family and film-enthusiasts gathered at Atrium Stadium Cinemas in Eltingville  to support this local-grown film from Purple Cloud Entertainment. The film was directed and written by Michael Robert Anderson, who plays one of the lead roles in the film as well. <i>Victoria Priola | vpriola@siadvance.com</i> <b>About the film </b> Here&#x27;s the story behind the film: &quot;Major Key&quot; is set during the height of WWII in a German village. A group of soldiers in hiding are taken in by a German family, where a story of forbidden love is stitched together by a shared love for jazz music. The daughter in the German family -- played by actress Sabrina Matarazzo of New Jersey -- is a jazz musician who sparks the interest of a singing soldier. Even with a slight language barrier, their love for a good tune brings them together. The title &quot;Major Key&quot; is meant to be a play on military and music terms. Trailers for upcoming projects from Purple Cloud, Richmond City Media, Fuzz On The Lens Productions and other Staten Island filmmakers like Michael Maugeri and Melissa Pellicano played before the film. With trailers, the entire display was 35 minutes long. In a short amount of time, “Major Key” told a detailed story of love, war and music. Without giving much away, I can tell you first-hand that this film was aesthetically pleasing, with the help of appropriate special effects and solid lighting. And yes, it was super emotional. <b>Alas, there is no hope in seeing &#x27;Major Key&#x27; online anytime soon.</b> But here is a trailer to keep you on your toes until late 2018, when Anderson says the film &quot;might&quot; surface the web. <i>Victoria Priola | vpriola@siadvance.com</i> <b>Nothing like the support of a brother </b> Before the screening, Gaten Matarazzo — brother of “Major Key” star Sabrina Matarazzo, who just so happens to be on a small indie show called Stranger Things — snuck into one of the theatre’s top row to show support for his older sis. This move, however, did not go unnoticed by a crowd of teenage girls who were snapping photos and calling out to him from below. To this, he smiled but motioned them to simmer down. When approached for a photo-op, he said “I’m not going to be taking any photos tonight, this is for my sister.” Respect. But we did snap this photo of him reacting to his sister&#x27;s presence being announced at the screening. If you can&#x27;t place him, he&#x27;s the one with his arms up, dead center. <i>Victoria Priola | vpriola@siadvance.com</i> <b>Now, here are some photos of the evening. </b> Some of the cast and crew at the screening of Purple Cloud Entertainment&#x27;s film &quot;Major Key&quot; at Atrium Cinemas on December 5, 2017.

The Great Kills resident worked out of his home studio for his drawings and printmaking and also had a studio at Snug Harbor’s Art Lab where he was also a teacher. Many of those works and the works of some of his friends such as artist Herman Zaage were offered during an estate sale at his residence. According to Nanette of Victorian Brothers Estate Liquidations who conducted the sale, “my staff & I were blown away by his massive Collection.” Offered were many of his paintings, sculptures, drawings and prints and those who purchased those were asked to give their name and info so they could be contacted for a future show of his work that Nanette is trying to organize. His son John Busacca said that he was always drawing. He said,” he’d get a pen and ink and be talking on the phone with his friends and he’d make these amazing 8x10 pen and inks like it was nothing.” According to John many of those pieces would eventually end up as large paintings. <i>Bill Lyons | lyons@siadvance.com</i> <b>Works on paper</b> Works on paper by the late artist Salvatore Busacca selling for between $25 and $200 at the estate sale at his Great Kills home and studio. <i>Bill Lyons | lyons@siadvance.com</i> <b>Oil paintings</b> Painting by the late artist Salvatore Busacca are being sold from $50 to $3000 at the estate sale at his Great Kills home and studio. <i>Bill Lyons</i> <b>A look at dad&#x27;s work</b> The late artist Salvatore Busacca&#x27;s children John Busacca and Marie Busacca Cardone look through some of his sketch books during his estate sale at his Great Kills home and studio. <i>Bill Lyons | lyons@siadvance.com</i> <b>The studio</b> Shoppers look at work in the studio at the late artist Salvatore Busacca&#x27;s estate sale at his Great Kills home and studio. <i>Bill Lyons | lyons@siadvance.com</i> <b>Works on paper</b> Works on paper by the late artist Salvatore Busacca selling for between $25 and $200 at the estate sale at his Great Kills home and studio.",

      "full": "STATEN ISLAND, N.Y. -- Having lived with the Fresh Kills Landfill, known to be the world&#x27;s largest garbage dump, Staten Islanders have more motivation than most to recycle and help reduce the pile, so to speak -- even if it isn&#x27;t here any more. To that end, here is a review of what needs to be done and some coaching from the Department of Sanitation Commissioner Kathryn Garcia. New York City&#x27;s curbside recycling program has two streams. Paper and cardboard, the green stream is one; metal, glass and plastic -- blue -- is the other. In some North Shore neighborhoods, there is also pick up of food scraps and yard waste for composting. Mixing what should be recycled in with your trash can get you fined, but says Sanitation Commissioner Kathryn Garcia, increasing revenue is not the goal, increasing recycling is. &quot;We much rather not write a ticket. At the end of the day, we want to be upping the recycling tonnage, and we want partners in the public,&quot; said Garcia in a phone interview. She provided the insider perspective that an experienced sanitation worker can tell the difference between a bag that is food waste and one that contains bottles. There is a different density, a different feel, she said. &quot;If there is a significant lack of compliance, the sanitation worker can call a supervisor and a ticket may be issued,&quot; she said. The fine is $25. When you want to comply but you are not sure. &quot;There are many things people put in the black bags we can recycle. We prefer people err on the side of maximizing recycling,&quot; she said, mentioning rigid plastic and aluminum foil in particular. High-tech equipment is much better at separating out the stuff that shouldn&#x27;t be there. However, one of the exceptions is styrofoam. Garcia explained that the styrofoam breaks up, is difficult to separate out and so contaminates the bales at the end of the process. That makes being attentive at this time of year, particularly important, with items from online shopping being delivered. &quot;You really need to separate cardboard from the styrofoam. We want the cardboard, but not the Styrofoam,&quot; said Garcia. As for other refuse at this time of year. Christmas tree lights and glass ornaments cannot be recycled. Wrapping paper, gift boxes, cardboard and other paper packaging can go out with other paper recycling (remove tape, ribbons and other decorations).  Eggnog cartons, wine bottles, olive containers, cookie tins and hard-to-open rigid plastic packaging are easy to recycle alongside the rest of your metal, glass, plastic and cartons. Creative ideas to cut down on waste and for recycling during the holidays can be found at www.grownyc.org/holidaytips. ------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------- Ever wonder how the city deal with all the stuff that goes in to the side of the truck for glass, plastic and metals. It is a high-tech operation that helps sort out non-recyclables. The vendor, SIMS Municipal Recycling, produced this video that illustrates the journey of a plastic bottle from being purchased, separated from the metal and glass, processed and makes its way back to the shelf. REGULATIONS FOR RECYCLING: For more information and to answer questions, visit the DSNY Zero Waste website. Paper and cardboard (green stream): With paper and cardboard, the rule of thumb is if you can tear it, it can be recycled.  It all goes to Pratt Industries in Travis. Here is a catchy video to remind you how to recycle paper. And here is a checklist of items. Holiday hint: Wrapping paper, gift boxes, cardboard and other paper packaging can go out with other paper recycling (remove tape, ribbons and other decorations). Paper: Cardboard: Plastic, glass and metal (blue stream): Holiday hint: Eggnog cartons, wine bottles, olive containers, cookie tins and hard-to-open rigid plastic packaging are easy to recycle alongside the rest of your metal, glass, plastic and cartons. Plastic is probably the most ubiquitous container item in our society. The DSNY expanded its list of plastics that it recycles from the early days of the program. &quot;There are lots of opportunities that with a tad more effort, we would get a lot more material,&quot; said Garcia. For example, she said, shampoo bottles are in the bathroom; recycling bins are usually in the kitchen. The impulse is to just throw it out in the bathroom bin -- one of those times that call for extra effort. The rule of thumb with plastics: &quot;All of those things you can squish in your hand, you can&#x27;t recycle,&quot; says Garcia.  That includes stryrofoam, film plastics, and baby food pouches. Rigid plastics that should be recycled are:",

      "full": "STATEN ISLAND, N.Y. -- The neighborhood of Bulls Head sits on the west shore of Staten Island, bordered by New Springville, Bloomfield, Willowbrook, Graniteville, and Westerleigh. As a child on our family Sunday drives, we would often stop near the farms for ice cream. It was located where the Richmond County Bank is now at Lander Avenue and Richmond Avenue. I recall they had the coldest outside water fountain. I just learned it was a Tastee-Freez.<br/><br/>The name Bulls Head originated from an 18th-century tavern that was located at the corner of Victory Boulevard and Richmond Avenue, it hung a sign bearing a bull&#x27;s head, and was called the Bull&#x27;s Head Tavern. This tavern stood in what today is one of Staten Island&#x27;s busiest intersections and was used as a Tory headquarters during the American Revolution. <br/>Bulls Head and the surrounding neighborhoods were dominated by farmland until builders came in and seemed to take over in the late 1960&#x27;s. Some familiar farm owner names were, Chrampanis, Meyer, Georges, Costas Thanasoulis, Anagnostic and the only remaining farm farther south in New Springville the Decker Farm. This dramatic change came soon after the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge opened in 1964, opening up Staten Island to suburban development. <br/>&quot;It&#x27;s painful now to drive through the streets here now,&quot; said Cheryl Bontales, former Bulls Head resident who&#x27;s family owned a truck farm on Merrill Avenue from about 1948-1980. The Criapis family along with many other Greek immigrants were founding members of the Greek Orthodox Church which stands as a corner stone of the community, then and now.<br/><br/>During the growth spurt of Bulls Head, many families settled in the area creating an ethnic mix of residents including Jews, Italian Catholics served by Our Lady of Pity R.C. Church and Orthodox Greeks who farmed much of the land and started the Holy Trinity-St. Nicholas Greek Orthodox Church. The Staten Island annual Greek festival is an island-wide favorite even today.<br/><br/>Today Bulls Head is a thriving community with many schools, medical practices, shopping areas, and the Hillside Swim Club.<br/><br/>Listen to Cheryl Bontales as she tours us through the prevailing community.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>",

I don’t subscribe to the theory that they are “purer” than adults. Kids are the sum total of the folks who created and raised them. I was working with a young boy the first year I taught and, in the middle of structured playtime, he turned to me and, apropos of absolutely nothing, said: “Women is ******* and ya can’t do a thing with ’em.” And then, immediately returned to his play. I’ve worked with kids that were abused and beaten. I’ve worked with kids in wheelchairs and walkers. I’ve worked with kids who were selectively mute or just couldn’t stop talking. I’ve worked with kids that are deaf or language delayed or emotionally disturbed. I’ve worked with kids that loved to draw, or rhyme, or play music, or curse like a sailor. I’ve worked with kids that were way ahead of their time and those that were so far behind they couldn’t see the end zone. I’ve worked with kids that were brilliant, and kind and caring and those that were lost in the forest of their own self-hatred and anger at the world for putting them there. And, I loved all of them. Every single last one of them. And when you love a child, you try to clear the path for them, but they always have to walk it alone. Always. The saying goes that, before we are old and wise, we must first survive being young and stupid. I don’t believe children are ever stupid. I think they move on instinct and instinct is a good thing, because it comes from a higher place. Maybe your future life. Maybe a caring God giving you hints. Who knows? It’s a survival skill that we all need to develop. Some kids are smarter than others, and that’s due to so many variable factors: genetics, wealth, environment, accessibility to objects of learning, an ability to read and comprehend, good spelling habits. It might even come down to what you had for breakfast or whether you bothered to eat breakfast or whether you can afford a breakfast to eat. So many factors. And a teacher has to figure out which ones are in play on a day to day basis. One thing that always strikes me: Kids are always amazed that you see them. Maybe because they’re lower to the ground. Maybe because you’re way taller.",

      "full": "STATEN ISLAND, N.Y. -- Live fish, Peking ducks and freshly steamed pork buns are no more at Asian Food Markets in Travis. The grocer with its in-house restaurant at 1801 South Ave. officially closed Monday. But the good news for fans of the sprawling store -- known as a rich source of ingredients for Chinese, Filipino, Japanese, South East Asian and West Indian cooks -- is that it will reopen as Asian Food in Mariners Harbor. Its new address will be 2343 Forest Ave. in a shopping complex under development by Waldman Partners of West Brighton. The project is expected to be completed in November 2020, according to the “Work In Progress” posting at the site. The complex is also expected to house Burger King and Popeyes restaurants, said a rep for the contractor. Asian Food Markets was the second major Asian food retailer to land in the borough. It was established in the summer of 2006 following the arrival of Kam Man Foods. Kam Man opened in December 2005, and was located on Forest Avenue in Mariners Harbor where Western Beef now lives. Both Asian Food Markets and Kam Man ventured to Staten Island, as noted by reps of both stores when they opened, to appeal to its blossoming Asian populations. In the interim, Asian Food can be found at 701 Route 440 in Jersey City, N.J., and 1339 Centennial Ave., Piscataway, N.J. On Staten Island, other places to source ingredients for Asian dishes include Phil-Am Foods, 527 Tompkins Ave., Rosebank; 718-876-6948, which specializes in Filipino items and has a restaurant across the street, Phil-Am Kusina.

The convenience West Brighton offers, and the fact that the entire family all lives within a three-mile radius of this neighborhood, made it the perfect place for the McCarthy family to buy its first home. “This house is everything we wanted and more,” Liz McCarthy said. This Colonial home on the top of Hart Boulevard was built in 1899. However, it had been empty for many years, which wreaked havoc on its interior. Radiators leaked. Support flooring needed replacing and kitchen and bathrooms needed gutting. This did not discourage Liz and Jack McCarthy from the task. While they embarked on the renovation, they carried kids in tow: Jack, now 3, and twins, Grace and Rory, 2. They closed on the house in May of 2017 and moved in during November 2017. Not bad for the extensive work done on the home under their direction. Jack McCarthy is a Sandy Hook pilot, who did much of the work himself. And his wife, a busy mother of three little ones, has an eye for design. The goal was to keep the home’s original charm, with details like wood moldings and a stained glass window in the dining room. That which had to be replaced was copied from the original, such as the stairway railings and post, and some of archway molding. The large garage was taken down to open up the backyard, while french doors were added to the dining room. The doors open to a deck, and walls were also reconfigured to open the house to light and to create a better flow.",

      "full": "STATEN ISLAND, N.Y. -- In the constant struggle to control costs, food businesses on Staten Island began passing along credit card processing fees to customers. The practice popped up over the summer on Staten Island when restaurants gradually introduced “cash discount” programs. Rather than raise prices on the menu which, proprietors say, is a turn-off to customers, food businesses have established prices for those who pay cash and those who pay by credit card. The “differential pricing,” as it is referred to by New York State statutes and in recent court cases on the matter, eases the pinch on proprietors who see a portion of gross receipts go toward credit card and bank services for each transaction. So, is it legal for restaurants, delis and grocery stores to do things like “cash discounts?&quot; New York General Business Law 518, on the books since 1984, says, “No seller in any sales transaction may impose a surcharge on a holder who elects to use a credit card in lieu of payment by cash, check, or similar means.” Violators are penalized for such a misdemeanor with a fine of $500 or less or imprisonment for up to a year, or both. But the Court of Appeals recently maintained it was legal so long as the consumer didn’t have to any math to arrive at the actual cost of the item. After reading through the decision, attorney Robert Helbock, a partner with Helbock, Nappa, Gallucci, LLC in Willowbrook said, “On the menu, it’s got to give the higher price, the credit card price...just posting a percentage isn’t good enough.&quot; “Any kind of merchant can indeed participate in what they call differential pricing.

Scott Kelly, founder and keyboardist, places the ensemble’s beginning at the height of the recession in 2009. He’d heard that food pantry shelves were empty, with lines that stretched for blocks. Wanting to help, he rallied some local musicians for a holiday-themed benefit concert. Not only did audiences respond well to the show, but they wanted to know: Where could they buy the music? Was there a holiday album? Now based out of Frenchtown, N.J., Kelly has watched the band grow from a few local guys with instruments to a 12-person musical group that performs across the nation. He says their Holiday Rock Opera is infused with the spirit of the season. “The feeling that Christmas is about family, loved ones, and helping your fellow man -- it’s the spirit that comes over you and we hope that we leave you with that spirit,” Kelly explains.",

D&#x27;Arrigo, Class of 1946, posthumously, Jeanne DeSapio Weeman, Class of 1950, Dr. Eugene Mosiello, Class of 1962, Henry W.

The program consisted of a presentation of colors by the NJROTC, welcoming remarks by Trevor A. Mills, president, remarks by Gregory Jaenicke, principal, and presentation of honors, which was followed by a gala reception. A LITTLE ABOUT THE HONOREES Surrogate D&#x27;Arrigo, Class of 1946, served on the bench for nearly four decades before his death in 2016. He served in the U.S Army stationed in Germany during the aftermath of World War II. While a student at Curtis High School he met Norma Formica, who was also a Curtis student. They were married upon his discharge in 1949. In 1973, after almost two decades in private practice as a general practitioner in St. George, he was elected Civil Court judge. He also served as an Acting Supreme Court Justice and the judge-in-charge of the Staten Island Civil Court. Governor Hugh Carey appointed him Richmond County Surrogate after his predecessor died in office and he was re-elected to the position twice. Upon reaching the mandatory retirement age of 70, he stepped down from the bench. After retiring, Surrogate D&#x27;Arrigo took a position as counsel with the firm of Hall & Hall, and held that position until 2013. Norma D&#x27;Arrigo, wife of Surrogate Charles D&#x27;Arrigo, accepted the award on behalf of her late husband. <i> From left, Jeanne DeSapio Weeman, Class of 1950 and Trevor Mills, president. (Courtesy/Bill Higgins) </i> Jeanne DeSapio Weeman, Class of 1950, was a class officer each year at Curtis. She taught at PS 13 for 18 years and developed a &quot;sensu-organic&quot; teaching approach to the teaching of reading for challenged elementary school students and designed an internship to apply this theory. Louis DeSario, superintendent of schools, District 31, chose Jeanne to be one of three teachers to implement a specially designed reading program as part of the Reading Continuum at Wagner College for challenged elementary students. She retired in 1987 and became her husband&#x27;s caregiver. She also put into print &#x27;Bobby&#x27;s Pet Piglet,&#x27; a story of one of his favorite childhood experiences. <i>Honoree, Dr. Eugene Mosiello. (Courtesy/Bill Higgins) </i> Dr. Mosiello, Class of 1962, was captain of the varsity football team at Curtis. He taught for two years at Our Lady of Mount Carmel-St. Benedicta school. After obtaining his degree in dentistry and orthodontics he served for 15 years as director of orthodontics at Staten Island Univeristy Hospital. Active in a number of local charitable organizations, a role for which he&#x27;s received myriad awards, Dr. Mosiello has been a mentor to many of his colleagues and in 2013 the Richmond County Dental Society awarded him its Lifetime Achievement Award. <i>From left, Henry W. Murphy, Trevor Mills and State Supreme Court Justice Michael Brennan.

He received the prestigious George Wingate medal as student athlete in the class of 1959. Upon graduation he held teaching positions on Long Island and Staten Island and was selected to the US Army Dependent School System to teach science in the Heilbronn Elementary School in Germany. In 1971 he was selected by the community superintendent to join the staff of a new initiative regarding the growing epidemic of substance abuse. He was selected principal of PS 11 in 1987 and has been heavily involved in community activities. <i>Karlus Trapp, Class of 1971, a singer/songwriter.

But he is perhaps best known as a singer/songwriter and exceptional troubadour. He has been featured in clubs, festivals, concerts and fundraisers throughout the tri-state area and beyond. He produced three CD&#x27;s. &quot;Wow,&quot; &quot;S&#x27;Alright,&quot; and &quot;Songs of Kenya.&quot; A teaching artist, Trapp received a number of citations, awards and prizes in film festivals and beyond. <i>Honoree Jeanne DeSapio Weeman, fourth from right, smiles for the camera.

      "full": "The Ridiculous 6 Adam Sandler stars in &quot;The Ridiculous 6.&quot; (Courtesy photo | Netflix) Movie critics, myself included, often have missed the point while assessing Adam Sandler pictures. We criticize his films for not having &quot;narrative flow,&quot; &quot;character development&quot; or &quot;a consistent tone,&quot; for being &quot;poorly photographed,&quot; &quot;sloppily edited&quot; or &quot;directed by lesser apes.&quot; Truthfully, bashing Sandler for being &quot;not funny&quot; is an attempt to slaughter the pig with a cotton swab. It&#x27;s become increasingly clear that Sandler is transcending the very concept of comedy, seeking existential blankness, a course through the cinematic universe entirely lacking in effort, creative expression and human emotion. His latest, &quot;The Ridiculous 6,&quot; won&#x27;t even show in movie theaters - via a fresh movie deal with Netflix, it beams directly into our homes, officially casting aside any notion of cinema being a collective experience best experienced in as large a venue as possible. I picture the apex of Sandler&#x27;s career occurring when he chooses to make no film at all, astral-projects his consciousness into the void, and it does not laugh. But until then, we are forced to study his work only as we are capable. &quot;The Ridiculous 6&quot; is best contextualized as a feeble send-up of classic Westerns. The title itself is a nod to John Sturges&#x27; genre landmark &quot;The Magnificent Seven&quot; (also referenced by Quentin Tarantino&#x27;s upcoming homage &quot;The Hateful Eight&quot;). Its musical cues derive from the eccentric signature twang of Ennio Morricone&#x27;s scores, which assisted in rendering director Sergio Leone&#x27;s &quot;Spaghetti Westerns&quot; masterworks. &#x27;The Ridiculous 6&#x27; 1 star (out of 4) Rated: TV-14 Cast: Adam Sandler, Rob Schneider, Taylor Lautner, Terry Crews Director: Frank Coraci Run time: 119 minutes &quot;Ridiculous&quot; also shows Leone&#x27;s visual influence - he frequently contrasted wide, scenic shots of gorgeous desert expanses with quick-zoom close-ups on gunslingers&#x27; eyes, which darted side-to-side in active assessment of tense confrontations - the face also can be a landscape. Some of Leone&#x27;s most highly regarded works starred Clint Eastwood as a man of no name and few words, and Sandler borrows that stoic persona, displaying at least the superficial appeal of his predecessor, assuming the octogenarian icon has a rough case of shingles. &quot;Ridiculous&quot; was certainly filmed in some beautiful locations; probably New Mexico, since it has excellent canyons, scrub-woods and film-production tax incentives. It casts Sandler as a white man raised by American Indians - Tommy Stockburn, but named &quot;White Knife&quot; by his adoptive family. On his person he carries no less than nine knives, one tomahawk and one scimitar - I counted - the metallic weight of which surely prevents the character from floating out of the frame, off the screenplay page and into an ultimate black ether, for the performance is an impressive blankness, a jokeless, voiceless yelp into an oblivion only a talent such as Sandler can touch.",

      "full": "On the surface, Zhang Yimou&#x27;s Chinese period drama &quot;Coming Home&quot; is a moving and emotional story of love, of loss and of the pain of being forced to live simultaneously with the two. And if that&#x27;s all you get from Zhang&#x27;s nicely shot, beautifully acted film, that&#x27;s plenty. But there&#x27;s more there as well -- layered on top of the central story is political subtext, a history lesson, a cautionary tale -- all of which imbue Zhang&#x27;s film with an intriguing and rewarding depth. In addition to providing plenty of meaty subject matter for those who want to dig deeper than the story&#x27;s surface romance, those layers also end up rescuing &quot;Coming Home,&quot; particularly when it flirts with the sort of maudlin, soap-opera style melodrama you&#x27;d more expect to find in a Nicholas Sparks novel. What we end up with is a film that boasts a satisfyingly and comfortingly old-fashioned feel -- and one that feels somehow larger than its limited urban settings and more crowded than its deceivingly small cast. In fact, as much as anything it&#x27;s the contributions of that cast, which features two well-known Chinese actors and one promising newcomer, that just might be the key to making &quot;Coming Home&quot; the emotionally absorbing film that it is. Based on the novel by Geling Yan, Zhang&#x27;s film is set against the backdrop of Mao Zedong&#x27;s Cultural Revolution, an effort started in 1966 to scrub any shred of traditional or Western culture from Communist Chinese society, replacing it instead with Maoist ideology. Any sign of dissent -- from political activists, from educators, from free-thinkers in general -- was greeted with imprisonment, torture and, as a result, widespread paranoia. Among those imprisoned dissenters: the lead character in Zhang&#x27;s tale, a former college professor named Lu Yanshi and played by Chen Daoming. When me meet him in the film&#x27;s heart-racing first act, he has just escaped from the labor and re-education camp where he had been sent years earlier. His goal: to return home to his wife, Feng Wanyu (frequent Zhang collaborator Gong Li, as essential here as ever) and their teenage ballerina daughter, Dandan (Zhang Huiwen, a young revelation), whom Lu hasn&#x27;t seen since she was 3 years old. Naturally, the authorities are hot on his tail. Also naturally, they&#x27;re ready, willing and able to do anything at all to get information that will help them collar him. Zhang makes maximum use of the energy and drama of that initial 30-minute segment. In addition to pulling his audience into the story with a sense of out-of-the-gates momentum, he uses it to set up seamlessly the rest of his film by introducing his three main characters and subtly offering insight in what makes each tick. When Lu eventually makes it home, he is devastated to learn that his wife no longer recognizes his face. Suffering from what is diagnosed as psychogenic amnesia -- likely brought on by extreme emotional stress, we are told -- she insists this older Lu isn&#x27;t her Lu at all. The more he insists, the more upset she gets, eventually throwing him out of their apartment and onto the street. Her real husband, she is convinced, is still in prison. Prompted by one of the myriad reminders with which she has plastered her apartment (&quot;turn off the light,&quot; &quot;don&#x27;t lock the door&quot;), she says she must go pick him up at the train station on the 5<sup>th</sup> of the month, as he instructed her in what she believes was his most recent letter. In an O. Henry-worthy twist, she loyally, heartbreakingly does just that. Every single month. Meanwhile, Lu busies himself with various undeniably sweet schemes -- posing as a piano tuner so he can play her a familiar tune, as a neighbor so he can read to her his letters, anything that will allow him access to his wife&#x27;s apartment and to her life. His hope is that he can come up with some means of jogging her memory and reigniting the fire between them. The question quickly becomes if she will ever recognize him. And if she doesn&#x27;t, whether it really matters. The central metaphor at work there is none too subtle, as China continues to reconcile itself with the Cultural Revolution. But it never gets in the way of Zhang&#x27;s overall story. With its old-fashioned feel and its inescapable romance and sentimentality, it wouldn&#x27;t take much for a cynic to dismiss Zhang&#x27;s film as so much weepy poppycock. For those who buy in and give themselves over to it, however, it promises to be a memorable, and even haunting, cinematic journey. _____________",

He reportedly spent $2 million to purchase the album, according to Bloomberg Businessweek&#x27; fantastic article. The album was an experiment by the group in the wake of declining record sales in the music industry. They would release just one copy of the album not for commercial sale. The buyer could do anything he or she wanted with it. The clan didn&#x27;t anticipate the buyer could be such a controversial figure, though. Shkreli is the CEO of Turing Pharmaceuticals, which drew controversy when it purchased the drug Daraprim and raised its price from $13.50 a pill to $750. The move led BBC to write that Shkreli &quot;may be the most hated man in America.&quot; Shkreli attended a private bidding session held by the auctioneers of the album, Paddle8 and ended up making the winning bid. After the rap group&#x27;s mastermind RZA learned that Shkreli was the new owner of the album, he emailed the business magazine a statement: &quot;The sale of &#x27;Once Upon a Time in Shaolin&#x27; was agreed upon in May, well before Martin Skhreli&#x27;s [sic] business practices came to light. We decided to give a significant portion of the proceeds to charity.&quot; RZA said the group would be donating some of the proceeds to charity. As for the album? Shkreli hasn&#x27;t bothered to listen to it yet, he told Bloomberg. &quot;I could be convinced to listen to it earlier if Taylor Swift wants to hear it or something like that,&quot; Shkreli told the magazine. &quot;But for now, I think I&#x27;m going to kind of save it for a rainy day.&quot; If you purchase a product or register for an account through a link on our site, we may receive compensation.

Kendrick Lamar leads everyone with 11 nominations, while other top contenders Taylor Swift and The Weeknd each seven each. The 58<sup>th</sup> Grammy Awards take place Feb. 15 on CBS. But who was left out of the mix in the top categories? Album of the Year Who missed out? Foo Fighters - &quot;Sonic Highways&quot; The Grammys usually place one rock album in the year&#x27;s top category. It likely came down to Foo Fighters&#x27; &quot;Sonic Highways&quot; or Alabama Shakes&#x27; &quot;Sound & Color.&quot; Dave Grohl and company are no strangers to the Grammys, but Alabama Shakes&#x27; album was simply better. D&#x27;Angelo & The Vanguard - &quot;Black Messiah&quot; D&#x27;Angelo earned a nomination for Record of the Year, but his excellent &quot;Black Messiah&quot; missed out on Album of the Year. It probably didn&#x27;t help that the album was a surprise release that didn&#x27;t generate a hit single. Mark Ronson - &#x27;Uptown Special&#x27; Ronson&#x27;s latest album, &quot;Uptown Special,&quot; was overshadowed by its massive single &quot;Uptown Funk.&quot; Hamilton Original Broadway Cast Recording While the groundbreaking musical &quot;Hamilton&quot; proved to be one of the more celebrated cultural achievements of the past year, it failed to make the mainstream impact needed for a Grammy nomination. Song of the Year Who missed out? Mark Ronson feat. Bruno Mars - &quot;Uptown Funk&quot; Voters honored &quot;Uptown Funk&quot; in the Record of the Year category, viewing it as a performance record, rather than a songwriting standout. Rihanna feat. Kanye West and Paul McCartney - &quot;FourFiveSeconds&quot; Rihanna&#x27;s single featured two Grammy favorites. But the song didn&#x27;t exactly move mountains. It came and went out of the public consciousness pretty fast. Common feat. John Legend - &quot;Glory&quot; At this point, it feels like the Oscar-winning anthem from &quot;Selma&quot; came out forever ago, which is probably why voters overlooked it. Record of the Year Who missed out? Taylor Swift feat. Kendrick Lamar - &quot;Bad Blood&quot; Swift was a lock for both categories. Though, it wasn&#x27;t certain whether voters would opt for &quot;Blank Space&quot; or &quot;Bad Blood.&quot; Rightfully, &quot;Blank Space,&quot; the better tune, won out. Jack U feat. Justin Bieber - &quot;Where Are U Now&quot; For the most part, Grammy voters got &quot;Record of the Year&quot; right. But the brilliantly produced &quot;Where Are U Now&quot; was certainly worthy of a nomination. The track may have been too youth-oriented for the older voters. Best New Artist Who missed out? Fetty Wap Typically, you&#x27;ll find a rapper featured in the Best New Artist category. The genre&#x27;s best bet was Fetty Wap. But the &quot;Trap Queen&quot; star&#x27;s name just didn&#x27;t resonate enough in mainstream circles. Hozier Hozier&#x27;s hit single &quot;Take Me to Church&quot; earned a nomination for Song of the Year at the 2015 Grammys. Perhaps he hasn&#x27;t done enough since then to warrant a nomination for Best New Artist. Walk the Moon",

      "next_sentence_true": "&quot;The Wiz Live!&quot; was also a social media sensation.",
      "full": "&quot;The Wiz Live!&quot; eased on down the road Thursday night, and this third live NBC production of a classic musical drew, in general, enthusiastic reactions on social media, positive reviews, and, no doubt for NBC, a huge sigh of relief. With networks yearning for &quot;event&quot; programming, which will draw eyeballs to the TV in real time, as opposed to watching it later, &quot;The Wiz Live!&quot; was the latest example of NBC putting on a live show. The first two, &quot;The Sound of Music Live&quot; and &quot;Peter Pan Live,&quot; were a mixed bag. &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; was a ratings hit --- it was watched by 18.5 million people on its initial airing -- and featured Carrie Underwood&#x27;s star power (and wooden acting.) &quot;Peter Pan&quot; took a ratings dive, and suffered from a sluggish pace, and miscasting (Christopher Walken&#x27;s half-asleep Captain Hook.) Final viewership numbers aren&#x27;t yet in, but Deadline reports that &quot;The Wiz Live!&quot; drew 11.14 million viewers, a 43% improvement over &quot;Peter Pan.&quot; And &quot;The Wiz Live!&quot; was up against the stiff competition of CBS&#x27; broadcast of the Green Bay Packers vs. Detroit Lions NFL game. &quot;The Wiz Live!&quot; was also a social media sensation. The Wrap reports that &quot;The Wiz Live!&quot; was &quot;the most social live special program in Nielsen Twitter TV history. That excludes awards shows and political events, and dates back to October 2011... Last night, 279,400 people sent 1.6 million tweets about The Wiz Live!...and 6.4 million people saw those Tweets a total of 128.9 million times.&quot; Even though there were far fewer &quot;hate-watch&quot; Tweets, of the sort that greeted Underwood&#x27;s performance, for example, there was one less-than-joyful social media element. The Wrap also reports that &quot;The Wiz Live!&quot; coincided with a 74 percent increase in Tweets that used the word &quot;racist.&quot; From The Wrap post: &quot;Among the massive Twitter use last night during NBC&#x27;s production of &#x27;The Wiz Live!,&#x27; a pretty ugly side conversation swept the social media nation. From 8-11 p.m. ET, 19,098 tweets mentioned &#x27;All-Black,&#x27; and 14,076 tweets were generated around the term &#x27;All-White&#x27;&quot; per Amobee Brand Intelligence. Worse yet, there were 21,357 tweets surrounding the word &#x27;Racist,&#x27; which was an increase of 74 percent from the immediately preceding three-hour time period.&quot; Aside from those social media bad vibes, there are plenty of reasons why &quot;The Wiz Live!&quot; scored with viewers -- and a few ways it could have been better. Here&#x27;s my take on what worked, and what didn&#x27;t. What worked: A great cast: Newcomer Shanice Williams was Dorothy, and while she was, as they say on the singing competition shows, a little pitchy here and there, her voice was strong, and she had a natural, down-to-earth appeal as a Dorothy who just wanted to go home (once she found out what that meant.) The stars in flashier roles rose to the occasion, with Queen Latifah as The Wiz, Mary J. Blige as a spirited Wicked Witch of the West, Amber Riley a blue-haired delight as the Good Witch of the South, and &quot;Orange is the New Black&quot; Emmy-winner Uzo Aduba in surprisingly strong voice as Glinda, all doing especially good work. It was also a treat to see Stephanie Mills, who originated the role of Dorothy in the 1975 Broadway production, as Auntie Em. Eye-candy costumes: From Glinda&#x27;s glowing golden gown, which looked like spun sunlight, to The Wiz&#x27;s spectacular green ensemble, the costumes were a show in themselves. Everything went smoothly: Watching a live production can be downright suspenseful if you feel like things could go wrong. (Technically, those of us on the West Coast didn&#x27;t see it live; we saw the tape-delayed version of the East Coast live show.) Will someone fumble a line, miss a cue, or will the scenery fall over? With &quot;The Wiz Live!&quot; it was easy to forget it was live, because everyone was so skillful they made it look easy. A catchy score: Charlie Smalls&#x27; music and lyrics were tuneful and energetic, and gave everyone -- from Ne-Yo as the Tin Man to Blige -- a chance to show off their vocal chops. Cirque de Soleil: There were just enough magical moments provided by members of the troupe to add to the atmosphere, without hijacking the production. An overall confident production: From the sets and digital effects to Kenny Leon&#x27;s direction and Fatima Robinson&#x27;s choreography, the show looked pretty close to ready for Broadway (the producers hope to take this show to Broadway.) What didn&#x27;t work: No live audience: A live show needs an audience, to react to showstopper numbers, laugh at a well-delivered line, and otherwise feed energy to the performers. It felt incomplete to see the cast give it their all, and not hear the applause they deserved. The commercials: Obviously, NBC does live productions because they want to make money, and they want viewers to sit there and be awash in sponsors&#x27; messages. But the way-too-frequent commercial breaks kept &quot;The Wiz Live!&quot; from building up a storytelling rhythm. It was so chopped up, it felt less like a story than a series of impressive numbers. The Tin Man, Cowardly Lion and Scarecrow got short shrift: Though Ne-Yo, Elijah Kelley, and David Alan Grier were all just fine, we didn&#x27;t get a sense of what makes the characters of Tin Man, the Scarecrow and the Cowardly Lion so distinctive. And we never felt like that trio and Dorothy were bonded, which made the finale less emotional than it might have been. Where&#x27;s Toto?: OK, it was a live show, and the last thing everybody needed to worry about was a dog deciding to bark, lift a leg, or wander offstage. Instead we got Toto only in the scenes set in Kansas. Sorry about that, Toto. If you missed it, you can watch the whole show on the NBC website. -- Kristi Turnquist",

He&#x27;s not sure what this Tuesday will bring at Tokyo Sushi. But he&#x27;s primed for business -- white kitchen cap in place, fresh chef coat on. He&#x27;s done his daily exercise already. For a workout, sometimes he runs along Victory Boulevard from his family&#x27;s Willowbrook apartment. It fuels his work, gets him in his restaurant game. He scooped up a hunk of salmon and carved several even slivers from the fatty fillet, a fish ribbon to bind rice and nori tucked with spicy salmon and warm, crunchy salmon skin. Tau, as regulars may know him, works six, sometimes seven days a week. &quot;My brothers think I&#x27;m crazy because I&#x27;m working so many hours. But I love it,&quot; said the chef, who came to Staten Island 17 years ago from Puebla, Mexico, &quot;because my friend told me he had a job for me. My first job, it was making sushi.&quot; His first restaurant stop in the States was former Sushi Den of Bulls Head. That place prided itself on over 150 custom sushi rolls, named and spelled out on posters wallpapering the restaurant. Customers could call out creations like the &quot;Debbie Roll&quot; or the Number 37 (&quot;Jay&#x27;s Roll&quot;) -- eel sauce-on-yellow tail-on-masago combo with scallion and sesame seeds to boot. Tau recalls the volume of fish the restaurant ran through: 80 or 90 pounds of tuna a week. &quot;It was a lot,&quot; he said with a smile. But he loves cutting fish. After two owners of Sushi Den, Tau &quot;went to work in the city.&quot; He did three Japanese restaurant tours in Manhattan. Three years ago, his connection to Sushi Den brought him to Tokyo Sushi owners, Hwa Kim and her husband, Youn. Tau is quite happy to be back on Staten Island and enjoys serving regulars who are back to see him from those Sushi Den days. When he&#x27;s not working, he savors time with wife, Maria, and two daughters, one who attends the College of Staten Island.

      "full": "Dalton Trumbo is a colorful, contradictory character, ripe for the cinema. He wrote screenplays great and terrible, many of them while he sat in the bathtub, smoking cigarettes and washing down amphetamines with booze. As a Communist Party member, he was on Hollywood&#x27;s blacklist, and spent time in prison for it. He &quot;talked like a radical, but lived like a rich guy.&quot; He won screenwriting Oscars for other people, who took credit when his name alone would have torpedoed a picture. In &quot;Trumbo,&quot; Bryan Cranston plays the iconic scripter during the height of the Red Scare, and the actor is a bundle of flamboyant tics and vocal flourishes. Friend and fellow screenwriter Arlen Hird (Louis CK) asks rhetorically of Trumbo, &quot;Do you have to say everything like it&#x27;s chiseled into rock?&quot;, the type of line that nudges the audience, reminding us that yes, this eccentric man could be bigger than life. It&#x27;s potentially treacherous material for Cranston, but, guided by &quot;Trumbo&quot; scripter John McNamara, he avoids character cliches and delivers a richly entertaining riff on the man, who offered no apology for who he was and what he believed in. &#x27;Trumbo&#x27; 3 1/2 stars (out of 4) MPAA rating: R for language including some sexual references Cast: Bryan Cranston, Diane Lane, Helen Mirren, Louis CK Director: Jay Roach Run time: 124 minutes It opens in 1947, when Trumbo was the world&#x27;s highest-paid screenwriter thanks to his work on &quot;Kitty Foyle,&quot; &quot;Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo&quot; and other films. He spoke out about economic inequality at the same time he owned an estate complete with a manmade lake. The film squares Trumbo off with dishy newspaper columnist Hedda Hopper (Helen Mirren) and John Wayne (David James Elliott), who flushed Communists out of the closet. He&#x27;s placed in front of Congress, and is sent to prison for contempt. Upon his release, he downgraded his lifestyle and began employing his wife Cleo (Diane Lane) and daughters as assistants while he churned out scripts to make a living, some of them for garbage B-films about gangsters and pirates, and some of them - &quot;Roman Holiday,&quot; &quot;The Brave One&quot; - for Oscar glory. These situations draw up opportunity for Cranston to grandstand, and he does, but always in the gregarious and inscrutable spirit of the character. Directed by Jay Roach and billed as a biographical drama, &quot;Trumbo&quot; is a comedy at heart, and I admired it for its lightweight approach to a heavyweight topic. The film boasts a heightened sensibility that opens it for big laughs, some inspired by a blustery, slippery Mirren, or a bellowing John Goodman, playing Frank King, a B-movie producer who brandishes a baseball bat when anti-Communists question his partnership with Trumbo, and therefore threaten his livelihood.",

(Francois Mori | The Associated Press) LONDON (AP) -- George Michael, the British pop superstar who reached early fame with WHAM! and went on to a solo career lined with controversies and chart-topping hits that blended soul and dance music with social commentary, has died, his publicist said Sunday. He was 53.<br/><br/>Michael died at his home in Goring, England. His publicist, Cindi Berger, said he had not been ill. His family issued a statement through Thames Valley Police saying that he &quot;passed away peacefully at home over the Christmas period.<br/><br/>&quot;The family would ask that their privacy be respected at this difficult and emotional time. There will be no further comment at this stage.&quot;<br/><br/>Police issued a statement calling the death &quot;unexplained but not suspicious&quot; and that &quot;a post mortem will be undertaken in due course.&quot;<br/><br/>Michael enjoyed immense popularity early in his career as a teenybopper idol, delivering a series of hits such as &quot;Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go,&quot; &#x27;&#x27;Young Guns (Go For It)&quot; and &quot;Freedom.&quot; As a solo artist, he developed into a more serious singer and songwriter, lauded by critics for his tremendous vocal range. He sold well over 100 million albums globally, earned numerous Grammy and American Music Awards, and recorded duets with Aretha Franklin, Ray Charles, Luciano Pavarotti and Elton John among others.<br/><br/>Throughout his career, his drug use and taste for risky sex brought him into frequent brushes with the law, most famously in 1998 when he was arrested for public lewdness in Los Angeles. Yet, he managed to turn the incident into fodder for a popular song that poked fun at his behavior, and his acknowledgment of his homosexuality at that time made him even more popular with his fans.<br/><br/>Michael, with startling good looks and an easy stage manner, formed the duo WHAM! with his school friend Andrew Ridgeley in the early 1980s. Helped by MTV, which was an emerging music industry force at the time, they easily crossed the Atlantic to become popular in the United States with Michael, as lead singer, usually the focal point.<br/><br/>He started his solo career shortly before WHAM! split, with the release of the megahit single &quot;Careless Whisper,&quot; making a seamless transition. Critics generally viewed his WHAM! songs as catchy but disposable pop and gave his solo efforts far higher marks.<br/><br/>His first solo album, 1987&#x27;s &quot;Faith,&quot; sold more 20 million copies, and he enjoyed several hit singles including the raunchy &quot;I Want Your Sex,&quot; which was helped immeasurably by a provocative video that received wide air play on MTV.<br/><br/>The song was controversial not only because of its explicit nature, but also because it was seen as encouraging casual sex and promiscuity at a time when the AIDS epidemic was deepening. Michael and his management tried to tamp down this point of view by having the singer write &quot;Explore Monogamy&quot; on the leg and back of a model in the video.<br/><br/>At the time, Michael had not disclosed his homosexuality, and much of his chart success was based on his sex appeal to young women. His look was raw and provocative, with tight jeans, tight T-shirts, black leather jackets and designer stubble, and his videos pushed the accepted limits with many lingerie-clad models vying for Michael&#x27;s attentions on screen.<br/><br/>But Michael&#x27;s situation changed abruptly in 1998 when he was arrested for lewd conduct in a public toilet in Los Angeles after being spotted by a male undercover police officer.<br/><br/>The arrest received international media attention, and seemed for a brief time to jeopardize Michael&#x27;s stature as a top recording artist.<br/><br/>But instead of making excuses for his behavior, he went on to release a single and video, &quot;Outside,&quot; that made light of the charges against him and mocked the Los Angeles police who had arrested him.<br/><br/>Like all of his efforts at the time, it sold in prodigious numbers, helping him put the incident behind him. The arrest also prompted him to speak openly about his sexual orientation.<br/><br/>These years represented the height of Michael&#x27;s commercial success, which at times was marred by a protracted legal dispute with his record company Sony.",

Chris Pratt plays Jim Preston, a civilian on a 120-year trip on the starship Avalon from Earth to the Homestead II colony. While 5,000 passengers and 258 crew members sleep, the craft bumps a large asteroid, inciting a malfunction, awakening Jim 90 years early. Whoops. Also: Oh crap. He&#x27;s the only one on the entire ship who&#x27;s not in suspended animation. He can&#x27;t repair his sleep pod or communicate with anyone back home, and his attempts to access the control room with a cutting torch and sledgehammer are fruitless. So he begins losing his mind. The pros of this situation: The ship is a massive, luxury liner, with a movie theater, basketball court and other enjoyable amenities, including the means to don a suit, tether and magnetic boots for an exhilarating spacewalk. Cons: it&#x27;s a big, empty place, with nobody to talk to except an android barkeep played by Michael Sheen, in scenes making direct visual reference to a far-from-stable Jack Nicholson chatting up the ghost bartender in &quot;The Shining.&quot; Jim is a working-class passenger with a working-class ticket, so he&#x27;s limited to ordering only black coffee from a computerized vending machine offering a plethora of cappuccinos and lattes. Which kinda sucks. Know what else sucks? Jim will spend the rest of his life alone, and die well before the Avalon reaches its destination. That&#x27;s a tough fate to accept, but Pratt has apparently been cast to keep us chuckling despite his character&#x27;s terrifying predicament. The plaintive, likeable actor is better at comedy than angst, so Jim&#x27;s gradual descent into space madness is more &quot;Ren and Stimpy&quot; than &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey.&quot; He grows a big, bushy Grizzly Adams beard, drinks too much and shuffles around like a zombie. To maintain his hunky physique and relieve some frustration (but mostly to maintain his hunky physique), he pounds the sand out of a heavy bag. With an almost convincing lucidity on his face, Jim contemplates the spacewalk option sans suit, but just. Can&#x27;t. Do it. A year goes by and then, what with one thing and another, a second passenger awakens. Aurora Lane is her name, which sounds like a heavenly body, or a street in an upper-middle-class neighborhood. She&#x27;s played by Jennifer Lawrence, photographed like the former, the character growing up on something approximating the latter, because she can get a mocha-whatever from the cafeteria automat with the irritatingly pleasant computer voice. At this point, &quot;Passengers&quot; shifts from an oddly toned isolationist drama - think &quot;Cast Away&quot; set on the &quot;WALL-E&quot; spaceliner, complete with goofy robots - to featherweight romantic comedy. Jim cleans himself up, and Aurora wears cute future-fashion outfits, and they banter lightly with the Michael Sheen artifice, playing video games, watching movies, while their long, drawn-out fate quietly hisses in the background like a slow gas leak. He builds a robot to deliver a handwritten card to her asking her on a date. She agrees. They gussy up and go out for a drink. &quot;It took you long enough,&quot; she says. &quot;I was giving you space,&quot; he says. &quot;Groan,&quot; goes the audience. To be fair, Jim understands that Aurora needs to accept things as they stand in a deep, depressive, inky-black puddle, and get the futile sledgehammering and problem-solving out of her system before he makes his move. He takes her on a romantic spacewalk, and then they smooch, and go to bed, with the stars gawking at the stars schtupping. But, as the trailer teases, Jim may be harboring a secret, and perhaps there&#x27;s a bubble about to burst. On top of that, foreshadowing has been occurring throughout this weird narrative assemblage of mental derangement, fluffy courtship and the constant, lingering idea that the characters will inevitably suffer lonely, tragic deaths, their dreams of a new life in an exciting new world annihilated by cruel circumstance. Various robots have been on the fritz, the lights occasionally blink out and a shot early in the film reveals there&#x27;s a thing on the ship known as a &quot;FUSION REACTOR.&quot; The combination of all this sounds pretty dangerous. In the film&#x27;s most ambitious sequence, the gravity goes out as Aurora swims in the space pool while wearing a lovely space swimsuit, and she&#x27;s trapped in a floating ball of water. This is serious. Not only might they die before they want to, but so will all the folks snoozing in their pods. At this point, &quot;Passengers&quot; shifts into a third mode, with plenty of running, sweating, gasping and stretching of fingers toward things just out of reach. So the movie has it all - laughs, romance, action - but doesn&#x27;t do any of it particularly well. The screenplay is slipshod and shotgunned with plot holes, built around underdeveloped, simplistic characters exchanging lousy dialogue, especially come the third act, when the exclamation point key gets a serious workout. One can sense director Morten Tyldum and writer Jon Spaihts aiming to hit the sci-fi/comedy sweet spot of &quot;The Martian,&quot; and banking on the charisma of Pratt and Lawrence to elevate the material, but it&#x27;s the kind of plot-driven stuff that handcuffs a player more than it enables. On one hand, it&#x27;s a grim thought experiment, and on the other, it&#x27;s difficult to take at all seriously.",

      "next_sentence_true": "But anyway, let&#x27;s get back to struffoli and other homemade traditions, admittedly some of which are tedious.",
      "full": "STATEN ISLAND, N.Y. -- About a week ago, my Aunt Annette presented a platter of struffoli she made from my Grandmother&#x27;s recipe. My great hope, whether it happens or not before Christmas, is to fry some up in our own home -- with the kids -- to keep that homemade tradition going. Struffoli are &quot;honey balls&quot; made with chick pea or all-purpose flour, rolled into marbles and stacked into a pyramid with nonpareils and, as their nickname suggests, a heavy drizzling of honey. Personally speaking, the crunch takes me back to my grandparents&#x27; Bay Ridge apartment, where the little things populated a two-tier platter on a dining room hutch. They were there for the nibbling all through Advent. These days, struffoli really are so ubiquitous on Staten Island -- massively-sized dough ball versions at ShopRite and available at almost every bakery -- that, I admit, it could be a discouraging chore to do at home. What&#x27;s the point when the experts can do them so cheaply and beautifully without all the muss in the kitchen? Still, it would be such a shame to lose such a sweet family tradition. But anyway, let&#x27;s get back to struffoli and other homemade traditions, admittedly some of which are tedious. When writing a story recently about Pasticceria Bruno&#x27;s beautiful panettone process -- the family crafts six versions which hail from a very specific, 30-hour regimen -- it may be evident not many people bake them from scratch anymore. As it turns out, master baker Biagio Settepani is one of the few professionals in the United States who dedicate the time for baking what are, in the end, rather complex breads. And, speaking of complex, the prep of traditional items really can be daunting, a surefire way to lose younger generations just on tastes for the items. Take baccala as an example. The other day at Montalbano&#x27;s Pork Store in Rossville, a lone box of the salted cod was on view in the middle of the shop. Co-owner Pasquale Parrelli said about a decade ago, at the Rosebank location, the family sold many boxes of them. But each year the inventory dwindles -- there is just not much call for the item. And, no wonder -- who has time for the process? This involves several soakings for the cod, water changes and meticulous pin bone plucking with tweezers, then the final prep into something edible like a salad or spread. My first attempt at baccala &quot;Grandma&#x27;s way&quot; happened just after our first son was born. To make a long story short -- that story starts with a newborn and ends with plumber&#x27;s visit to the house -- my husband ended up flushing the fish down the toilet. But good news: We&#x27;ve had better baccala results ever since. That brings us to lutefisk. Years ago, you could walk around Bay Ridge and pass several fish stores. A lot of these places made their own lutefisk (lye-soaked cod in barrels) that catered to the Norwegians in the neighborhood. Now, with Arlene Rutuelo and her mother Helen Bakke out of business at Nordic Delicacies, where can a Scandinavian get her fix of oily and/or gelatinous home-prepped fish? That would be at the occasional dinners and fundraisers at the Sons of Norway Lodge in Travis or by mail order to someplace out in Minnesota. The point of all this is that we should try to keep our food traditions alive. Pesky at times to do, yes. But at least, we can attempt to preserve a little of our collective histories in recording how things are cooked. So, might I suggest you enter a recipe in the 2017 Advance Cookbook Contest? The rules of entry are here in this link with the deadline about two months away.

The masterpiece on display at the Italian Cultural Foundation on Grymes Hill until Jan. 7th, is a gift of friendship and solidarity from the Naples, Italy, Chamber of Commerce to The New York City Fire Department in honor of the victims of Sept. 11, 2001 and the brave city firefighters, police officers and EMS workers who responded to the tragedy. The handcrafted work of art was created by master artisans of the Campania Region of Italy and is consistent with techniques that date back to the seventeenth century. It&#x27;s comprised of 120 handmade pieces including peasants to noblemen, the Holy Family, many animals typical of that time period, angels, a faux mountain, a stable and more. The artisan&#x27;s meticulous attention to detail and the beauty and warmth of the work of art is of museum quality. However, not only does it recreate a stable scene of Christ&#x27;s Birth, it&#x27;s magnificently unique in that it tells the story of the tragedy of Sept. 11, 2001, in a heartwarming way. Depicted are figures of the three Kings who, instead of bringing gifts of gold, incense and myrrh, present Baby Jesus with three New York City firefighters&#x27; helmets with the numbers 9, 11 and 01. In addressing the crowd, Gina Biancardi, founder and president of Casa Belvedere, stated: &quot;I am so happy to be able to exhibit this beautiful 120-piece artisan made &#x27;Presepio Della Solidarieta&#x27; so symbolic of how the tragedy of Sept. 11 impacted the world. Even the artisans in Italy told a beautiful story.&quot; She adds: &quot;Instead of carrying the gifts of the Magi, they&#x27;re carrying on their helmets 9/11/01. Even after seeing it all these years, each time I look at it, it&#x27;s like seeing it for the very first time.

      "full": "STATEN ISLAND, N.Y. -- It&#x27;s been a month since Donald Trump became our President-elect in one of the hardest-fought Presidential elections in history, ending in one of the most shocking upsets ever. Political analysts are pondering myriad factors, the least of which is the influence of celebrity endorsements and why the likes of Beyonce and Lena Dunham couldn&#x27;t do for Hillary what Oprah did for Barack Obama when he ran. Entertainers and athletes can bring out the elusive 18-24 demographic in droves, but this begs the question of whether celebrities should even be given political platforms at all to influence voters. With followers in the millions, for sure celebrities have influenced voters. But should they? I asked four students at St. John Villa Academy their opinion. Alyssa DiFalco, Dongan Hills Young people these days have become a lot more interested in politics because of the recent Presidential election. Therefore, celebrities have to be very careful on how they voice their opinion to their followers. I think celebrities, like all people, have the right to say whatever they want, but depending on how they express their political views, they may cause an uproar so they have to be cautious. Celebrities running for political office? I think they should stick to being celebrities because holding political office is such a different field and we need people with more experience to do those jobs. But then again, anyone can do whatever they want to. That&#x27;s up to them and voters to decide if they&#x27;re qualified. Victoria Corriere, New Dorp Everyone has their freedom of speech. It&#x27;s our First Amendment. But I don&#x27;t think that famous people should be as vocal as many are because it is a personal opinion and other people may not agree with them and some people may become very offended when celebrities support one candidate more than the other. I think more young people were interested in this Presidential election because Trump and Clinton were the candidates, although I have always followed politics closely. Celebrities seeking elected office? If they have experience in politics then I think it&#x27;s okay; but even if they didn&#x27;t, that&#x27;s their choice and everyone has the freedom to choose whether they should run for office or not. Kaitlyn Calderaro, Dongan Hills I think celebrities should only use their influence to voice their opinions on politics in positive ways. I believe that if they want to endorse a candidate, that&#x27;s acceptable. However, I don&#x27;t believe in negative talk and I don&#x27;t believe in talking badly about people. Are people easily influenced by what celebrities have to say? Yes, I think so. Personally, I have chosen some people in the public eye to be my role models, but only those who are good and who are a positive influence. I followed this Presidential election more closely because of the candidates but have always been interested in politics because it affects our country. I hope Trump brings this country back greatness. Maggie Cummings, Dogan Hills Famous people can use their celebrity as a platform to voice their opinion on politics because everyone has the right to feedom of speech.  They have a right to say who they are voting for but they do not have the right to tell people who to vote for. Celebrities should use their influence to educate the public on the candidates so they can make an informed decision and not vote for one person over another just because &quot;they said so.&quot; Celebrities running for elected office? I guess that depends on who the celebrity is. Some celebrities become famous at a very young age and they may be too inexperienced for the job. However, others may have gone to college and be well suited for public service. If you purchase a product or register for an account through a link on our site, we may receive compensation.

From here on in through Christmas, the staff is set on panetonne time. <i>Pamela Silvestri | silvestri@siadvance.com</i> <b>So, move over stuffoli. </b> Here&#x27;s something just as Christmas-y. Let&#x27;s take a tour through the process of panettone, an arduous regimen not intended for the faint or fickle chef. It takes about 30 hours to make, not including the taming of the yeast. That&#x27;s a process unto itself. <i>Pamela Silvestri | silvestri@siadvance.com</i> <b>Strap on a hair net. </b> Come, let&#x27;s take a tour of the whole way the Settepanis prepare panettone. When you come into the Pasticceria kitchen these days, you&#x27;ll see the special flour owner/master baker Biagio Settepani imports from Italy. <i>Pamela Silvestri | silvestri@siadvance.com</i> <b>The nuts, the ingredients...</b> Are carefully picked and sourced. Almonds here are ready for roasting. <i>Staten Island Advance/Pamela Silvestri</i> <b>Then, there&#x27;s the &#x27;mother.&#x27;</b> Says Biagio Settepani, the master baker, &quot;The pannetone, the process is that we have this natural yeast. It stays dormant, this lieveto madre. Once we start approaching the holidays we start feeding it more frequently — water and flour. So, as we feed it the acidity goes down. You want to get the pH of the dough between 3.9 to 4.2. Then, once you have that ready to go, you start that process of making the panetonne.&quot; <b>The mother makes the dough. </b> &quot;I start at 7 a.m.,&quot; says Biagio. &quot;We soak the madre (yeast) in sugar water for 15 minutes and that&#x27;s called in Italian bagnetto, so you give it a bath to purify it. &quot;And, now you squeeze out the water,&quot; and weigh it, mix it with flour and water. &quot;And you make a nice stiff dough and you let it proof for four hours,&quot; says Biagio. <b>This guy: Biagio Settepani. </b> Biagio starts working at 5 a.m. and doesn&#x27;t leave until after 9 p.m., says one of his sons, Sal Settepani. <i>Pamela Silvestri | silvestri@siadvance.com</i> <b>What is panettone?</b> Panettone is a bread that can be likened to a souffle. Most bakeries sell it in a box or make it from a mix. It sports nuts, raisins, sometimes figs. It can be just straight bread. <i>Pamela Silvestri | silvestri@siadvance.com</i> <b>The recipe</b> Essentially, a panettone is water, sugar, flour yeast. The mixing, proofing and baking of the bread is on a strict schedule. With the yeasty dough, says Biagio, &quot;We divide that into two equal parts. Let it rest from 7 p.m. to 5 a.m, so it triples the volume. There’s absolutely no commercial yeast used in it. Hence the shelf life of the product is two to three months. It might get dry but no mold at all.&quot; <i>Pamela Silvestri | silvestri@siadvance.com</i> <b>The racks</b> These are special racks from Italy. We&#x27;ll get back to those in a minute. <i>Pamela Silvestri | silvestri@siadvance.com</i> <b>The baking</b> Then, there the Segundo Impasto or second dough with more flour, more sugar, egg yolks, butter and yeast. &quot;Then you do your flavors,&quot; says Biagio who specializes in several. He uses only Nielsen Massey-brand pure vanilla exract. A special orange-lemon-vanilla extract hails from Italy. He can add raisins, candied citron and candied orange. Finally, after another proofing, says Biagio, &quot;You round it up, shape it and put it in the mold. The large one bakes at at 55 minutes to an hour 347 degrees in a convection oven.&quot; <i>Pamela Silvestri | silvestri@siadvance.com</i> <b>The handling</b> &quot;Once they come out, this kind of pannetone it’s like a soufflé,&quot; notes Biagio. Here is his son Joseph carefully laying them out on a sheet pan. <i>Pamela Silvestri | silvestri@siadvance.com</i> <b>Next, the racking. </b>",

      "full": "&#x27;Miss Sloane&#x27; Jessica Chastain (front) plays the title character in &#x27;Miss Sloane,&#x27; alongside, from left, Noah Robbins, Grace Lynn Jung, Douglas Smith and Al Macadam. (Kerry Hayes/EuropaCorp) In the political drama &quot;Miss Sloane,&quot; Jessica Chastain plays the title character, a steely-eyed, stone-cold shark of a D.C. lobbyist who approaches her job less as craft and more like war. &quot;Lobbying is about foresight. About anticipating your opponent&#x27;s moves and devising countermeasures,&quot; she says ruthlessly at the film&#x27;s opening. &quot;... It&#x27;s about making sure you surprise them.&quot; The same came be said of moviemaking, especially when it comes to that last point -- although &quot;Miss Sloane&quot; director John Madden appears to have forgotten it. His nuance-free movie is built around two of today&#x27;s most hot-button political issues: gun control and the role of money in politics. But instead of using it to his advantage and giving audiences something resonant and relevant, he delivers a film that spends most of its time swinging back and forth between the preposterous and the predictable. There are fleeting moments in which Madden&#x27;s film, based on a screenplay by Jonathan Perera, flirts with realizing its potential. For starters, its setup is admittedly intriguing: Chastain&#x27;s crackerjack character, in a fit of moral pique, leaves the high-powered lobbying firm for which she works to instead champion a gun-control measure on behalf of a much smaller, much more ethical underdog firm. From there, she and her ragtag team of energetic but inexperienced Capitol Hill neophytes take on the big boys from her old firm. What follows is a tangled tale of no-holds-barred political maneuvering and out-maneuvering, peppered with the occasional behind-the-scenes betrayal. The overarching question: By the time the credits roll, will Chastain&#x27;s Miss Slone end up using her considerable skills to redeem herself? Or will she once and for all damn herself? On the one hand, it&#x27;s refreshing to see a woman get to play such a take-charge role. On the other, though, given how unsympathetic she ends up being, it&#x27;s hard to care very much. Maybe the resulting, sterilely shot drama offers a reasonably accurate portrait of how lobbying works on the Hill. But with so much else of the film ringing so glaringly false -- from the ham-handed plotting to the contrived dialog to Mark Strong&#x27;s not-quite-there American accent -- there&#x27;s really no reason to believe any of what Madden and company are peddling. Honestly: As smart and as career-driven as Chastain&#x27;s title character is, does anybody really think she would choose a John Grisham novel for recreational reading? That&#x27;s by no means intended as a slight to Grisham or his fans, but the one-track-minded Miss Sloane -- who pops pills to avoid losing hours to pesky slumber and who complains that eating is a waste of valuable time -- is a New York Times, Washington Post kind of woman through and through. In itself, that&#x27;s a fairly a minor quibble, but it&#x27;s fairly illustrative of the movie&#x27;s repeated missteps. (And don&#x27;t even get me started on her ridiculous relationship with a paid escort played by Jake Lacey, one of numerous flourishes of pointlessness in Madden&#x27;s film.) Visually and tonally, &quot;Miss Sloane&quot; -- like Chastain&#x27;s one-note performance, in which she does little but bark and glower -- is slick but soulless, a film that takes itself far too seriously and misjudges how smart it really is. By the time &quot;Miss Sloane&quot; reaches the end of its 132-minute running time, it has overstayed its welcome. It&#x27;s a shame, really. Given the timeliness of the themes at play, &quot;Miss Sloane&quot; could have been a movie of its time, one to remember. Instead, it ends up being a movie you&#x27;ll find yourself easily forgetting. ____________ MISS SLOANE<br/>2 stars, out of 5 Snapshot: Jessica Chastain stars in a Capitol Hill drama about a ruthless lobbyist who, in a fit of moral pique, leaves the high-powered firm at which she toils day and night to instead take a job with the opposition.

Here, we celebrate a year of Staten Islanders obliterating the borough’s tired stereotype with routine-shattering programming and norm-challenging performances, exhibitions and general hip-ness. Here’s a sampling of the young hot thangs who will make even more of a splash in 2016, be it with art, poetry, music, comedy or that indescribable-thing-they-do. AJ Pantaleo You can be a drummer backing a great band or you can be a solo drummer who does crazy experimental stuff. The talented AJ Pantaleo does both — and well. His December 18 solo performance in the Staten Island Arts Culture Lounge was the best example yet of this; his structure and composition helping to tell a story words cannot express; his instrument an extension of the psyche. It was an incredible performance, accompanied by some (also expertly-devised) ambient tones by Mike Dibenedetto. It’s especially thrilling when he teams up with visual artists, like he did with Brendan Coyle on Walkabout (see left). Pantaleo, who plays with the Staten Island band Bueno (also releasing a record any day now, watch out 2016), got his year started with a solo album, Walkabout. He received the Staten Island Arts Excellence in Arts award this year and has just released a new single, Hoi An. If that&#x27;s any indication of what his 2016 will look like, it&#x27;s going to be a great year for drumming on Staten Island. Nani Castle If you loved &quot;Commie Mommie&quot; as much as we did, get excited for Nani Castle&#x27;s 2016. This Staten Island hip-hop artist and daugher of a Chilean exile brings grit and swagger to the borough&#x27;s music scene. Over crisp beats and dance-worthy rhythms, Castle raps about breaking rules and making art in her home base of Stapleton. She celebrates the cultural diversity she&#x27;s come to appreciate here, as well as some of the tensions she&#x27;s observed. In 2016, expect to see her and frequent collaborator Udachi (another hot young thang who will blow it up in 2016) continuing to work together on the island. Castle also expects to drop an untitled EP with her musical partner NiRE (see Commie Mommie) later in 2016, as well as a video from her EP Radika set to drop in January. William “Starda” Perry This voracious hip-hop artist is eager to represent Staten Island with his music. He’ll have two EPs dropping in 2016: &quot;SOS: Starda of Staten Vol 1&quot; in February and &quot;SOS: Starda of Staten Vol 2&quot; in May under rapper Pharoahe Monch&#x27;s music label, W.A.R. Media. Producing the 2nd Annual SOS: Stories of Staten event at Snug Harbor from April 9th - May 14th. Celebrating various S.I. talents and brands. The event was influenced by the music. May 14th is the concert in the Music Hall and release party. <i>Lauren Steussy | lsteussy@siadvance.com</i> Lina Montoya Colombian artist Lina Montoya is probably the embodiment of sunshine. The muralist even flies south to her home country when the days get shorter — she needs daylight to do the public art she&#x27;s become well-known for here on Staten Island. From her iconic butterfly mural collaborations with the children of Port Richmond to her beautification projects, Montoya is making Staten Island a brighter place, brush-stroke by brush stroke. In 2016, she&#x27;ll be working in Stapleton with at-risk youth to beautify that area too. Rob Hart Author Rob Hart pounded the pavement as a newspaperman, was the mouthpiece of some politician named Domenic Recchia, and served as a commissioner for Gotham. All were perfect training for the Brighton Heights native&#x27;s future — as a hard-boiled crime novelist in the vein of greats like Dashiell Hammett and James M. Cain, not to mention modern masters like Lawrence Block and Dennis Lehane. &quot;New Yorked&quot; (Polis Books) was a critical success: reviewers raved at the &quot;teeth cracking prose&quot; Hart employs to tell his &quot;stubbornly dirty story of love, betrayal, and loss.&quot;  He&#x27;s not done yet, though. In February, Hart will release the sequel to the book, &quot;City of Rose.&quot; Better preorder it now, folks. Pauline Herveaux Expect the unexpected with comedienne Pauline Herveaux. The young talent and Miss Hibernia 2015 with bright red hair is the queen of dirty-but-oh-so-honest jokes on the Staten Island comedy scene. She draws from her life as a single woman, looking for a partner, if not at least a one-night-stand. In addition to hosting several comedy nights around the borough, she performed this year at the legendary comedy club Caroline&#x27;s and has dabbled in television appearances. Joon Chung He may not have been cast in Aziz Ansari&#x27;s buzzed about Netflix series, but we love him anyway. Chung, who is currently working the New York City stand-up comedy circuit, also forms one part of the comedy group &quot;Super Secret Show&quot; with Manny Rondon, Matt Lynch, Joe DeAngelo, Mike Bryk and Zack Chapman — who share this recognition for their hilarious work. One only needs to watch this attached video to be convinced that their delightful comedy has an invaluable place on the borough. <i>Staff-Shot</i> The Folks at Flagship Since opening Flagship Brewing Co. in 2012, the founders of Flagship Brewery have not only managed to get their (phenomenally delicious) beer into bars all over the city and bottles everywhere from the corner store to Whole Foods — they’ve made their tasting room a place for community. They provide more music and entertainment programming than any other venue actually built for such activities. From Oysterfest to Staten Island Seisiuns, go to Flagship almost any day of the week to get a taste for the culture of Staten Island, literal and artistic. Jayburn Park-Isum Voted the second-favorite hip-hop artist by Staten Islander readers in our 2015 poll, Park-Isum has been writing raps since he was 13 years old, continuing the legacy of Shaolin rap on the label American Waste Camp records. He’ll have a new EP out in March. Here’s a taste of what’s coming up in 2016 for Jayburn. Dolltits This lady trio stormed onto the music scene in what felt like the blink of an eye, filling a need we never knew we had here for some really solid riot grrrl country. Dolltits is comprised of Barbara Russo on vocals and guitar, Serpica on vocals, ukelele, autoharp and keys, and Therina Bella on vocals, guitar, autoharp, keys, ukelele and &quot;various other noisy things.&quot; Performing around the city, they use their platform not only to bring the world great music, but also raise awareness for issues like domestic violence. <i>Photo by Mike Shane for Illuminate Stapleton</i> 5050 Skatepark Ed Pollio and Angelica Popolano are the owners and operators of 5050 Skatepark, which has become so much more than just a skatepark in the last few years. From “Musication” to film screenings, they’ve turned an unconventional space into a place for community. Tattfoo Tan The visual artist with a studio in St. George has become one of the city’s greatest assets. Tan was recently awarded an artist’s grant from Joan Mitchell Foundation and was appointed by the mayor to the Citizens&#x27; Advisory Committee for the city&#x27;s comprehensive cultural plan — true to Tattfoo Tan style, he documented the opening of his appointment with a primitive took (left). His work centers on sustainability and environmental stewardship, with regular updates on social media about his projects, from bow-making to dyes made of local plants. Jay Miller With his alternative comedy show “Midevenings with Jay Miller” back up and running on the Manhattan News Network, comedian Jay Miller appears poised to do that thing he does in 2016, which is better than him not doing that thing he does. <i>Lauren Steussy | lsteussy@siadvance.com</i> Nani Ferreria-Mathews <br/>Ferreria-Mathews, one part of the gender-neutral clothing and goodies company Mustache Mermaid, is a multi-instrumentalist and recipient of this year&#x27;s Excellence in Arts award from Staten Island Arts. She just put out a beautifully ethereal album this year, sort of on the sly, called Festival. Her sound is at once gritty and dreamy. She has one of the most seamless sounds of any other performer on the borough; a delight to listen to and a treasure in the community. Alexandra Nyman Filmmaker and fashion blogger Alexandra Nyman is a recent Staten Islander but already she’s accomplished much. She contributes to the tourism blog This Way On Bay and has about a million film and fashion projects in the works. This year, she directed this music video for Young Lucid (watch out for him in 2016, too) at Staten Island’s Eve Ultra Lounge. DJ DIZZLE DJ Dizzle knows the hustle. You probably recognize his name from the many entertainment events he brings his beats to around the borough. He artfully blends old school hip-hop with deep, dirty dance beats. Check out his latest mix tape to the left. He is one third of the hip-hop group G.E.D. along with fellow badass performers Gia Dupree and Emon. Together, the group performs and spreads positive vibes throughout the borough and beyond.",

This year was no exception.

The heartwarming holiday concert -- geared for all ages and religious persuasions -- played to a packed house of more than 700 at the Bloomfield venue, where hoteliers Lois and Richard Nicotra served as co-chairs with Oscar-nominated actor Chazz Palminteri, the honorary chair. An integral part of the evening&#x27;s fare was a surprise auction for two orchestra seat tickets to Broadway&#x27;s &quot;A Bronx Tale,&quot; with a cast meet-and-greet and a backstage tour donated by playwright Palminteri himself.

Where there is a will (and a bus) there is a way. I had made a few buddies hanging around the park at the Todt Hill Houses, who also loved to play sports. We would play stickball for hours behind the park house and basketball games until well after the sun went down. Paddle ball games began at 7 a.m. Everyone played something. A few of us started talking about fishing. Plans were made and we started doing trips down to local lakes and ponds, then to the beaches on the South Shore of Staten Island. We would buy our sandworms the day before at Santo&#x27;s on Hylan Boulevard or Scaglione&#x27;s on Victory Boulevard. Cold cuts were procured and sandwiches were made in advance. Big milk jugs filled with Nestea iced tea and a Fig Newton&#x27;s sleeve or two. Packed coolers and all our gear in tow, we would hump it out to Great Kills Park on the 111 bus, over the hill to the South Shore. The bus would leave us a few blocks away, and then there is a road about a mile or so long from the Hylan Boulevard entrance out to the docks we fished on. We either hiked it or hitched a ride out to the marina. Three of us were Daily News paperboys, used to getting up early to deliver to our routes. After we delivered our Sunday morning papers, we found our way to the water. It kind of kept us out of trouble. If you had to rise at 6 a.m. on Sunday to go fishing, you weren&#x27;t staying out late Saturday making trouble. Not too late, at least. When I was around 14, we formed the Todt Hill Rod & Reel Fishing Club. We would seek out fishing spots all over Staten Island and Brooklyn. Bruce Rhodes at the Todt Hill Teen Center helped us get it together. We had bright yellow shirts made up with a crossed rods logo I designed by hand. I wore that tee shirt every trip until there was more hole than shirt. There were about 10 of us. We fished at least twice a month from March through November. In the winter we would meet and plan future excursions and discuss tackle and technique. My brother, Colin, began tagging along with the crew. He was seven years younger than me. He liked to sleep in and was a huge pain to get out of bed, but he always came. I made ham and bologna sandwiches for lunch and a couple of PBJ&#x27;s for to eat when we got to the dock. After his hot chocolate and my coffee, of course. We would sneak onto the docks of the marina. The fishing was so much better than the public bulkhead. Once in a very blue moon, one of the boat owners would complain and get us kicked off. We would usually sneak back a bit later. It was worth the risk. We&#x27;d invariably catch twice as many fish as the people fishing on the bulkheads. We were respectful kids and cleaned up after ourselves, so mostly they just let us be. The things that we pulled from the water were truly amazing: Winter flounder two inches thick, dozens of humpback porgies, doormat fluke, voracious cocktail bluefish, slimy eels that were four feet long and bushels of big Jimmy blue crabs. That was part of the allure to me. You just never knew what the day would bring. As we fished, we met other people who loved the sea. We were not rich, we did not own boats, but we did have a common connection to the sea. We lived in the nitty, gritty city, but we felt the primitive call of the ocean and all her possibilities. It was like we had been initiated into a brotherhood of people of all different backgrounds and ethnicity who loved to fish and heard the song of the sea, just like us. Some of those early March mornings were so windy and cold down at Nichol&#x27;s Marina. The howling wind would send the rigging of the sailboats whipping against their masts creating a bizarre symphony. I found an odd peace in the wind as it played on the water. Even on those early cold days of spring, someone would land a fish and that would keep the rest of us going. That and waiting for the bells of the familiar brown truck known as the Meal Mobile that just had the best hot dogs for a quarter. St. Patrick&#x27;s Day usually kicked off flounder season. The boys had a four or five year tradition of cutting school (with Mom&#x27;s permission) and fishing on the Dorothy B. for flatties. It took two and a half hours to get out to Sheepshead from Staten Island by bus, ferry and subway. Many seasons these would be the first fish we would catch, but early season flounder fishing is a lot of wishful thinking. Rarely would there be keeper flounder that early. Flounder are among the best of the best to eat. As the harbors and bays warm up and come to life, the flounder get fat and keepers would become more prevalent. The number of fish didn&#x27;t really matter. The season had begun once more and we were in it. THE CODE We developed an unspoken code as we fished together: * We did not kill what we didn&#x27;t eat. * No one threw any garbage in the water. * You had to help even the dorkiest guy catch a fish. Each summer, we explored and fished nearly every inch of Great Kills Harbor on the South Shore. Great Kills is a relatively deep water harbor that has been the launch point for fishing trips for decades. The harbor is shaped like the inside of a horseshoe with a narrow channel at its mouth. The marina was great for flounder, porgies, sea bass, snapper blues and crabs, but for fluke and a shot at bigger fish like stripers and bluefish, the inlet was where it was at. In August, blue crabs were everywhere along the docks and we would grab them with scoop nets from the pilings. We let the pregnant females go. A dozen big steamed crabs with melted butter was a great reward after a long day on the water. Don&#x27;t get me wrong; this was not &quot;A River Runs Through It&quot;. Norman McClean&#x27;s brilliant novel depicts his nearly religious trout fishing trips in the Montana of his youth. Our water was not always so pretty, but it was all we had. New York City may not bring to mind quaint nor exotic fishing locales. You might be surprised. If I said the Great Northwest you would picture me landing a mighty salmon. If I said Florida you might see a gorgeous mahi-mahi or billfish dancing on the water. Trout, you would picture Montana or western New York State, amid quiet meandering streams and a live line of fat rainbows sparkling in the cool water. But an old bucket with a big fish tails sticking out of it on the deck of a part boat was pretty cool to me. A few times each summer we would get a ride to Sheepshead Bay for trips on the party boats for the night trips for bluefish. These were rugged expeditions to foreign seas to catch lots of fish. The boat hawkers would call out at the cars as they passed: &quot;All night blues!&quot; It always reminded me of a New Orleans barker for some naughty nightclub with a great band. There was always a great mix of characters on board the boats. Every race and nationality that lives in Brooklyn (and that is a lot) has a portion of their population that fishes. Old Brooklyn&#x27;s Irish stalwarts from Breezy Point, Jamaican&#x27;s from Fort Greene and the Flatbush streets of my boyhood, Hasidim with the curls from Williamsburg, old time Bensonhurst Sicilians who claimed fishing roots back to Palermo, Indian guys with exotic lunches, Koreans who shared their lunches and just plain folk out for a day on the water. On one particular August night, Bruce, the director of the teen center at the Todt Hill Houses, loaded five or six of us in his beat up Dodge Dart and drove across the Verrazano Bridge into Brooklyn with the sun fading in the west. Most boat yards still provide free parking in the lots across Emmons Avenue. We parked and unloaded our two big coolers. The big, wide Amberjack pulled out of the bay at 7 p.m. all lit up like a holiday. The trip out is long and many groups begin to play cards. I liked to wait a while and see the city as we pulled out of the bay and into the ocean. Its big diesels cranked for three hours to a spot off the Jersey Shore. The big anchors are set before we make our first drop. We were on fish from the start. One after another, Ray and I nailed fish. The whole crew was hitting. When you lock into a school of bluefish it can last for hours. Your arms are good and ripped after pulling up 15 or 20 ten-pound fish. We caught dozens in the next two hours. Almost everyone had at least five. Ray was fishing to my left and this other guy on my right. He was not hitting fish at all. He was getting really aggravated. He was in his mid-30s. He was cursing the fact that he was not hitting fish. While listening to him I locked into another fish. He huffs and moves 10 feet down the rail. After a couple of minutes of fight I land a nice blue, around 12 pounds. Looking to my right, the guy is laying flat on his back, dead. It was on the news the next day. We sat in stunned silence on the way back. How could this happen? My old buddy Ray and I always compared observations on these trips. We would pay attention to the old timers they called &quot;sharpies&quot;. They came in all colors and sizes. The sharpies consistently caught more fish than anyone on the boats. It was all in their technique and choice of equipment. We used to watch them and learn. We spied on them like the CIA. When one of them caught a fish, we would interrogate each other searching for the secrets these guys possessed.&quot;What bait is he using? What kind of rig? How far off the bottom was he?&quot; Was he bouncing?&quot; These were serious matters and we studied like Ninjas. We started having smaller group pools for the &quot;high hook&quot; (most fish rather than biggest). I started to pull away from some of my more casual peers in fish totals. I employed new rigs, baits and techniques and my fish luck grew. Discovery has taken patience and patience has paid off handsomely over the years. We became better fishermen. I still fish with some of those guys.",

Bruce Rhodes at the Todt Hill Teen Center helped us get it together. We had bright yellow shirts made up with a crossed rods logo I designed by hand. I wore that tee shirt every trip until there was more hole than shirt. There were about 10 of us. We fished at least twice a month from March through November. In the winter we would meet and plan future excursions and discuss tackle and technique. My brother, Colin, began tagging along with the crew. He was seven years younger than me. He liked to sleep in and was a huge pain to get out of bed, but he always came. I made ham and bologna sandwiches for lunch and a couple of PBJ&#x27;s for to eat when we got to the dock. After his hot chocolate and my coffee, of course. We would sneak onto the docks of the marina. The fishing was so much better than the public bulkhead. Once in a very blue moon, one of the boat owners would complain and get us kicked off. We would usually sneak back a bit later. It was worth the risk. We&#x27;d invariably catch twice as many fish as the people fishing on the bulkheads. We were respectful kids and cleaned up after ourselves, so mostly they just let us be. The things that we pulled from the water were truly amazing: Winter flounder two inches thick, dozens of humpback porgies, doormat fluke, voracious cocktail bluefish, slimy eels that were four feet long and bushels of big Jimmy blue crabs. That was part of the allure to me. You just never knew what the day would bring. As we fished, we met other people who loved the sea. We were not rich, we did not own boats, but we did have a common connection to the sea. We lived in the nitty, gritty city, but we felt the primitive call of the ocean and all her possibilities. It was like we had been initiated into a brotherhood of people of all different backgrounds and ethnicity who loved to fish and heard the song of the sea, just like us. Some of those early March mornings were so windy and cold down at Nichol&#x27;s Marina. The howling wind would send the rigging of the sailboats whipping against their masts creating a bizarre symphony. I found an odd peace in the wind as it played on the water. Even on those early cold days of spring, someone would land a fish and that would keep the rest of us going. That and waiting for the bells of the familiar brown truck known as the Meal Mobile that just had the best hot dogs for a quarter. St. Patrick&#x27;s Day usually kicked off flounder season. The boys had a four or five year tradition of cutting school (with Mom&#x27;s permission) and fishing on the Dorothy B. for flatties. It took two and a half hours to get out to Sheepshead from Staten Island by bus, ferry and subway. Many seasons these would be the first fish we would catch, but early season flounder fishing is a lot of wishful thinking. Rarely would there be keeper flounder that early. Flounder are among the best of the best to eat. As the harbors and bays warm up and come to life, the flounder get fat and keepers would become more prevalent. The number of fish didn&#x27;t really matter. The season had begun once more and we were in it. THE CODE We developed an unspoken code as we fished together: * We did not kill what we didn&#x27;t eat. * No one threw any garbage in the water. * You had to help even the dorkiest guy catch a fish. Each summer, we explored and fished nearly every inch of Great Kills Harbor on the South Shore. Great Kills is a relatively deep water harbor that has been the launch point for fishing trips for decades. The harbor is shaped like the inside of a horseshoe with a narrow channel at its mouth. The marina was great for flounder, porgies, sea bass, snapper blues and crabs, but for fluke and a shot at bigger fish like stripers and bluefish, the inlet was where it was at. In August, blue crabs were everywhere along the docks and we would grab them with scoop nets from the pilings. We let the pregnant females go. A dozen big steamed crabs with melted butter was a great reward after a long day on the water. Don&#x27;t get me wrong; this was not &quot;A River Runs Through It&quot;. Norman McClean&#x27;s brilliant novel depicts his nearly religious trout fishing trips in the Montana of his youth. Our water was not always so pretty, but it was all we had. New York City may not bring to mind quaint nor exotic fishing locales. You might be surprised. If I said the Great Northwest you would picture me landing a mighty salmon. If I said Florida you might see a gorgeous mahi-mahi or billfish dancing on the water. Trout, you would picture Montana or western New York State, amid quiet meandering streams and a live line of fat rainbows sparkling in the cool water. But an old bucket with a big fish tails sticking out of it on the deck of a part boat was pretty cool to me. A few times each summer we would get a ride to Sheepshead Bay for trips on the party boats for the night trips for bluefish. These were rugged expeditions to foreign seas to catch lots of fish. The boat hawkers would call out at the cars as they passed: &quot;All night blues!&quot; It always reminded me of a New Orleans barker for some naughty nightclub with a great band. There was always a great mix of characters on board the boats. Every race and nationality that lives in Brooklyn (and that is a lot) has a portion of their population that fishes. Old Brooklyn&#x27;s Irish stalwarts from Breezy Point, Jamaican&#x27;s from Fort Greene and the Flatbush streets of my boyhood, Hasidim with the curls from Williamsburg, old time Bensonhurst Sicilians who claimed fishing roots back to Palermo, Indian guys with exotic lunches, Koreans who shared their lunches and just plain folk out for a day on the water. On one particular August night, Bruce, the director of the teen center at the Todt Hill Houses, loaded five or six of us in his beat up Dodge Dart and drove across the Verrazano Bridge into Brooklyn with the sun fading in the west. Most boat yards still provide free parking in the lots across Emmons Avenue. We parked and unloaded our two big coolers. The big, wide Amberjack pulled out of the bay at 7 p.m. all lit up like a holiday. The trip out is long and many groups begin to play cards. I liked to wait a while and see the city as we pulled out of the bay and into the ocean. Its big diesels cranked for three hours to a spot off the Jersey Shore. The big anchors are set before we make our first drop. We were on fish from the start. One after another, Ray and I nailed fish. The whole crew was hitting. When you lock into a school of bluefish it can last for hours. Your arms are good and ripped after pulling up 15 or 20 ten-pound fish. We caught dozens in the next two hours. Almost everyone had at least five. Ray was fishing to my left and this other guy on my right. He was not hitting fish at all. He was getting really aggravated. He was in his mid-30s. He was cursing the fact that he was not hitting fish. While listening to him I locked into another fish. He huffs and moves 10 feet down the rail. After a couple of minutes of fight I land a nice blue, around 12 pounds. Looking to my right, the guy is laying flat on his back, dead. It was on the news the next day. We sat in stunned silence on the way back. How could this happen? My old buddy Ray and I always compared observations on these trips. We would pay attention to the old timers they called &quot;sharpies&quot;. They came in all colors and sizes. The sharpies consistently caught more fish than anyone on the boats. It was all in their technique and choice of equipment. We used to watch them and learn. We spied on them like the CIA. When one of them caught a fish, we would interrogate each other searching for the secrets these guys possessed.&quot;What bait is he using? What kind of rig? How far off the bottom was he?&quot; Was he bouncing?&quot; These were serious matters and we studied like Ninjas. We started having smaller group pools for the &quot;high hook&quot; (most fish rather than biggest). I started to pull away from some of my more casual peers in fish totals. I employed new rigs, baits and techniques and my fish luck grew. Discovery has taken patience and patience has paid off handsomely over the years. We became better fishermen. I still fish with some of those guys. &quot;Over the rail and in the pail!&quot; is what we would cry when a nice fish came in. For years now, I have fished with old friends, my brothers, nieces, nephews, relatives and business colleagues. Fishing is a sport that is open to every skill level.",

      "full": "STATEN ISLAND, N.Y. -- As the hustle and bustle of the holiday season slowly wanes, and we look with enthusiasm toward an exciting, brand new year, several controversies remain. One of the latest is all the hoopla surrounding the Miss America Pageant, a 97-year-old Atlantic City tradition -- the splashy, sparkly competition that airs the Saturday after Labor Day each September. Pageant chief Sam Haskell, board chairman Lynn Weidner and board member Tammy Haddad have resigned, mainly due to slanderous emails between Haskell, Miss America big wigs and staffers. The resignations came after 49 former Miss Americas signed a petition demanding that they all step down, as did more than 1,600 state and local titleholders, contestants and pageant volunteers. Mallory Hytes Hagan, Miss New York turned Miss America 2013, who was crowned in the St. George Theatre, and who was referenced in those emails, noted on &quot;Good Morning America&quot; from her Alabama home: &quot;I hope the resignation by Haskell and other board members starts a conversation, and I think this is an opportunity to see how women can come together.&quot; Hagan added: &quot;I hope it signals the reinvention&quot; of the pageant. Now, in the wake of all the dissension, St. George resident Jim Smith, the Miss Staten Island executive director, has spoken. &quot;The days preceding Christmas were explosive for pageant fans with news flying fast and furious. And it all sounded so threatening. But now that we&#x27;ve all had a chance to catch our breath, let&#x27;s think this over.&quot; Smith, who also writes a column for silive.com, said he can&#x27;t help but call to mind the old adage: &quot;Don&#x27;t throw the baby out with the bath water.&quot; &quot;Swimming in the bath water are the top officials of the Miss America Organization board of directors. Throw them out with the bath water -- right off the boardwalk into the ocean,&quot; he said. &quot;I loved walking that boardwalk on those exciting September nights after a pageant. We would run into so many pageant friends from different states,&quot; said Smith, who faithfully attends the Atlantic City extravaganza each year. &quot;Let us keep Miss America &#x27;your ideal.&#x27; It&#x27;s the dream of a million girls who are much more than just pretty. And don&#x27;t let her drown in the bath water. The cream will always surface to the top.&quot; Cara Mund, the current Miss America 2018 from North Dakota, commented: &quot;It is after the heaviest of reigns that we discover the greatest of rainbows.&quot; FYI: The Miss America tradition began in the 1920s, when a league of businessmen brainstormed a &quot;Fall Frolic&quot; bathing-beauty contest on the boardwalk to extend the tourist season. It was then when one woman was crowned &quot;The Most Beautiful Bathing Girl in America.&quot; But these days, the organization&#x27;s focus is on showcasing the educational achievements, fitness and talents of its contestants.",

Like any good relationship, you must treat your partner with respect. I&#x27;ve lived near the waterways in three of New York City&#x27;s five boroughs and I&#x27;ve learned to read the currents that run near the jetties off Breezy Point to the Narrows under the bridge in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn and where the drop-off is at Crooke&#x27;s Point on Staten Island. The sea teaches you if you listen. And then without any warning, it can all change right before you. As dangerous as she is beautiful and for all I know, I know nothing. My mom and dad split and we moved back to New York in 1975. We left Los Angeles in a hurry one fine California Saturday afternoon, down the back hill to a waiting green van on the next block over. One of the last things I grabbed: Two paperbacks -- &quot;Moby Dick&quot; and &quot;Jaws.&quot; Then we went to the airport and back to Brooklyn. In my early years I would pour over the newspapers looking for news about local saltwater fishing. Sometimes finding fish was easier than finding information. I was curious to know more about the fish I could catch in the nearby ocean on the trusty Garcia light-spinning outfit my grandfather, Willie Duffy, had given me one Christmas in 1975. Then the Jaws phenomenon caused everyone to take a second look at the water.",

Marco and Tina Saponara&#x27;s youngest daughter, Gabriella, was dancing at halftime with the Brooklyn Nets Kids All Star Team. The 11-year-old got upstaged. Big time. Paul McCartney sat two rows in front of her parents Sunday. He caught a T-shirt and her parents are in the photo that immediately hit social media, garnering tens of thousands of views. &quot;Even millionaires love free stuff,&quot; posted ESPN, with a photo capturing the Beatles legend&#x27;s childlike glee. Marco (in a white T-shirt) and Tina (with glasses and a white scarf) can be seen thoroughly enjoying the moment in the background. &quot;He was into the game; he was dancing in his seat. He was having a good time,&quot; said Tina. Sir Paul was there with his wife and an entourage of all ages, she said. &quot;And he went crazy for a T-shirt just like any normal person would have,&quot; she added. When they first got to the game, Tina dropped off Gabriella with the dance team, while Marco and older daughter Nicolette, 15, went to their seats. (Both girls dance on the company team of Triple Essence Dance Studio, and play soccer and basketball.) The seats were in the 11th row, center. Impressed, Nicolette texted a photo to her mom: &quot;This is our view.&quot; Marco followed with a text of his own: &quot;Paul McCartney is sitting in front of us.&quot; Tina eventually made her way up to the seats, and the beginning of the game was spent texting friends and receiving messages from friends in upper-level seats who were taking photos of them near the Beatles legend. &quot;The whole time we were like, &#x27;Oh my God,&#x27;&quot; said Tina, a teacher at PS/IS 163. When it was time for the T-shirt toss, Tina and Marco stood up, but Nicolette passed. &quot;You think you&#x27;re really going to get a T-shirt?&quot; she chided her parents.

      "full": "STATEN ISLAND, N.Y. -- The chalk white exterior of the landmarked Bennett House will become the canvas for an LED light installation in the shape of the &quot;Betsy Ross flag&quot; at 6:30 p.m. Thursday. The holiday display at Historic Richmond Town, 411 Clarke Ave., is part of the Staten Island Historical Society&#x27;s history driven, future-focused approach to reimagining New York City&#x27;s only living history village. &quot;Historic Richmond Town is the ideal backdrop for a modern take on the historic Betsy Ross flag,&quot; said artist Scott LoBaido.&quot;I can think of no better place for this installation than at the heart of Staten Island, in the heart of New York City, the heart of America.&quot; The light installation is part of a new partnership with the patriotic artist and a group of borough leaders devoted to helping Historic Richmond Town raise much needed funds to revive the Billiou-Stillwell-Perine House at 1476 Richmond Road in Dongan Hills. As the oldest surviving building on Staten Island, it is one of few such treasures still standing on its original foundation state and nationwide. &quot;Scott has traversed the country painting flags in every state on a mission generate a country-wide love and appreciation for the stars and stripes,&quot; adds Historic Richmond Town Interim Executive Director Ken Bach. &quot;The Bennett Cafe, a labor of love of the Women&#x27;s Auxiliary of Historic Richmond Town and located in the Bennett House, is the ideal location for celebrating the role of women in building a strong country. The flag, representing the original 13 colonies through modern LED lighting demonstrates the enduring value of American ingenuity.&quot; Bach adds the display would not be possible without the generous donation of materials and support from Dennis McKeon, executive director of Where to Turn, adding, &quot;we are grateful for Scott and Dennis and their dedication to celebrating a love of country at Historic Richmond Town through this dramatic installation, and the upcoming exhibit and fundraiser in support of our Billiou-Stillwell-Perine House.&quot; When the very first walls and roof went up on the Billio-Stillwell-Perine House, circa 1662 , the borough was still owned by nature. Thriving wetlands and thick vegetation stretched for miles, interrupted only by Lenape Indians cultivating fields and one tiny, Dutch settlement. The British had yet to lay claim to the land, and it would be more than 100 years until this great experiment called the United States of America would take shape. The Billiou-Stillwell-Perine House had already passed through several prominent Dutch and British families by 1792, when the flag we now know as the &quot;Betsy Ross Flag&quot; became a symbol for the 13 American colonies. Edward Perine took possession of the home in 1764, overseeing the addition of English-styled wooden sections to the original, rough fieldstone structure over subsequent decades. The family owned the home for more than 100 years, until it was purchased by the now defunct Staten Island Antiquarian Society in 1915. Descendants of the Perine family will be among those on hand this Thursday, when LoBaido flips the lights on his 16-by-24-foot holiday light display of the historic flag -- brightening the night sky on the shortest day of the year. The Perine family -- and thousands of Staten Islanders who viewed the home&#x27;s interior after it opened to the public in 1953 -- can describe how its unique Dutch jambless fireplace similarly worked to battle darkness long, long before electricity or modern LEDs had even been dreamed possible. MORE ABOUT THE BILLIOU-STILLWELL-PERINE HOUSE: Historic Richmond Town is dedicated to bringing this history to life with a campaign to reopen the landmark building to the public.  In 2013, the community coalesced around the cause -- uniting to restore its then dilapidated roof. A community initiative led by Staten Island Advance Editor Brian Laline, artist Scott LoBaido, contractor Steven LoBaido, and Iron Hills Civic Association President Dr. Mohammad Khalid brought matching funds to a $25,000 pledge by Executive Director of Richmond County Savings Foundation Cesar Claro for a new roof.<br/>Thanks to their generous support plus donations from hundreds of individuals, groups and families, the Billiou-Stillwell-Perine House received.a new roof in 2014. The Staten Island Historical Society continues to raise funds to complete the next phases of work to restore the building, which remains at its original location for 356 years. This Staten Island treasure, on the National Register of Historic Places, has stories to tell and history to teach current and future generations. The LED light installation Thursday is a step toward showing what that future can hold. If you purchase a product or register for an account through a link on our site, we may receive compensation.

Like many Christmas traditions, the origin of this delicious custom originated years ago as part of Medieval European rituals conducted long before Christmas became the huge commercial holiday it is today. Take Annette Vantine, for example, who knows it all to be true. A great-grandmother at 81 years young, the Tottenville resident has been making Christmas cookies for generations. And, according to her granddaughter, Pamela Malandro, that&#x27;s the true definition of what being a grandma is all about.

Manhattan</b> &quot;Manhattan&quot;: You know there&#x27;s an abundance of quality shows when WGN America -- the cable channel known for airing sports and reruns -- offers one of the year&#x27;s most compelling series. &quot;Manhattan&quot; Season 2 was even better than the first, as the story of scientists and soldiers involved in building the first atomic bomb at Los Alamos, New Mexico, gained in tension and intensity. The ensemble cast is among TV&#x27;s best, and William Petersen was an inspired addition. <i>FOX</i> <b>9. Empire</b> &quot;Empire&quot;: When it burst upon an unsuspecting public in January 2015, &quot;Empire&quot; was a big, bold, brassy blend of primetime soap, scored to a hip hop soundtrack. Unapologetically melodramatic, this modern spin on &quot;The Lion in Winter&quot; boasted over-the-top plot twists, family drama, and, best of all, Taraji P. Henson as the indomitable Cookie Lyon. Season 2 has gotten off to a disappointing start, but here&#x27;s hoping the second half of the season gets its groove back. <i>FX</i> <b>8. Justified</b> &quot;Justified&quot;: The FX series went out on a high note, with a finale that saw Deputy U.S. Marshal Raylan Givens (Timothy Olyphant), cleaning up assorted messes, dispensing justice, and having one last, unforgettable exchange with his silver-tongued opposite number, Boyd Crowder (Walton Goggins.) <i>PAUL SARKIS/Showtime</i> <b>7. The Affair</b> &quot;The Affair&quot;: The Showtime drama explored new depths of emotion in Season 2, as the story expanded to include the point of view of the scorned spouses of the couple whose affair set the drama in motion. Joshua Jackson was touching as the ex-husband of Alison (Ruth Wilson) and Maura Tierney was a powerhouse as Helen, ex-wife of the monumentally self-absorbed Noah (Dominic West.) <i>HBO</i> <b>6. Silicon Valley</b> &quot;Silicon Valley&quot;: A superb comic ensemble, and more hiliarious, but stingingly accurate points about life in the high-stakes world of digital start-ups, made Season 2 of HBO&#x27;s comedy the most timely show on TV. <i>Ursula Coyote/AMC</i> <b>5. Better Call Saul</b> &quot;Better Call Saul&quot;: Season 1 of the &quot;Breaking Bad&quot; spinoff only had 10 episodes to find its tone and begin the story of how a lawyer named Jimmy McGill became Walter White&#x27;s sleazeball attorney, Saul Goodman. But there was enough there to make this one of the most promising, original new shows of the season. And Bob Odenkirk&#x27;s lead performance was funny and touching. <i>Craig Blankenhorn/FX</i> <b>4. The Americans</b> &quot;The Americans&quot;: The already outstanding drama about Soviet spies pretending to be an average American couple in the Reagan-era 1980s deepened in Season 3, as Philip (Matthew Rhys) and Elizabeth (Keri Russell) saw the effect their double life had on their own family. <i>HBO</i> <b>3. Game of Thrones</b> &quot;Game of Thrones&quot;: Though there were slow moments, Season 5 of &quot;Game of Thrones&quot; again reminded us that there&#x27;s no show that combines character drama, showstopping spectacle, and breathtaking battle scenes like HBO&#x27;s hit. And then there was that climactic Jon Snow (Kit Harington) cliffhanger. <i>Justina Mintz/AMC</i> <b>2. Mad Men</b> &quot;Mad Men&quot;: The seventh and final season wasn&#x27;t perfect. Sending Don Draper (Jon Hamm) away from New York on a cross-country search for whatever was a mistake, for example. But there were enough richly satisfying moments in this hugely influential show&#x27;s farewell lap to make me sad to say goodbye to the characters, the setting, and creator Matthew Weiner&#x27;s stubborn insistence on doing things his way. <i>Chris Large/FX</i> <b>1. Fargo</b> &quot;Fargo&quot;: Season 1 of Noah Hawley&#x27;s brilliant anthology series was my choice for the best show of 2014. Season 2 was even better. Hawley and his team again captured the black humor and surprising violence of the Coen brothers&#x27; original movie. But &quot;Fargo&quot; Season 2 was its own impressive achievement. Patrick Wilson was understated decency personified as Lou Solverson, the Midwest lawman trying to restore order as criminal chaos threatened. The rest of the cast was stellar, the story took unexpected turns, the 1979 setting was deftly communicated without relying on kitsch, and Hawley refused to condescend to his characters. &quot;Fargo&quot; is a peak achievement of the so-called &quot;peak television&quot; era. <i>NBC</i> <b>TV 2015: 10 awful moments</b> While the 2015 year in TV brought gripping drama and clever comedy, it also spawned some moments that ranged from depressing to dismal.

      "full": "Hoover Athletic Association in central Alabama has a rich 50+ year history of serving the community with a strong focus on instilling important life lessons into every athlete. The non-profit organization totals more than 1,000 athletes participating in baseball, football, and cheerleading. Mike Plaia, president of Hoover Athletic Association, knows his role well. He’s in charge of growing the association and ensuring that each volunteer and coach knows the organization’s mission and carries it out during every practice, game, and activity.  <source srcset=\"/sites/default/files/images/Mike_Plaia.png 1x\" media=\"(min-width: 0px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"240\" height=\"240\">                   <img src=\"/sites/default/files/images/Mike_Plaia.png\" width=\"240\" height=\"240\" alt=\"Mike_Plaia\" loading=\"lazy\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\">    </p  </div>          </article> </div>  <p> <strongName:</strong Mike Plaia<br <strongOrganization: </strong<a href=\"https://www.hoovereast.com/home\"Hoover Athletic Association</a<br <strongPosition:</strong President<br <strongSportsEngine Tools Utilized:</strong Registration, Sitebuilder, Billing, Tourney, League As a non-profit organization with a staff of volunteers, turnover for all positions is high — Plaia knew that because of this, he needed to create a single source of truth to create continuity for the organization and future association leaders. Plaia also knew that continuity would be tough to achieve with the organization using multiple companies to handle their registration (SI Play and TeamWall Communications), scheduling (Quickscores), and their homegrown website. SportsEngine delivered all the tools that Hoover Athletic Association needed to operate efficiently, all on one platform — creating the continuity Plaia knew they needed. SportsEngine provided a custom website, online registration, team and league management tools, and payment processing services. “When I first became president of the association a few years ago, we really didn’t have a good online presence or documented history and mission for anyone to gain an understanding of the organization,” says Plaia. “My first order of business was to fix that and to find a technology partner that could help us grow and centralize all our information.” Plaia found that partner in SportsEngine. “The new website from SportsEngine has been huge for us,” says Plaia. “We have separate pages for all our teams, a centralized location for coaches and parents to find schedules, a place to share urgent messages, and the ability to host online registration.” “Plus, and maybe most important to me, we have a home for our organization’s mission and history,” says Plaia. “Being a non-profit, everyone is a volunteer, and turnover for most positions is very high. The challenge for us is to sustain the culture we have built well into the future.” “Now, when someone is new or a family is researching us, they can just go to our website and find everything they need to understand both what we stand for and what we do,” says Plaia. “We’re building our history through SportsEngine, and we now have a template for future leaders to follow.” Of course, the website is more than just a single source of truth for the organization, it’s also a powerful marketing tool. “Before SportsEngine, our website was really basic and just didn’t look good,” says Plaia. “We didn’t even encourage people to visit it.” “Now, with SportsEngine, the website looks great, and families check often for scores, standings, schedules, photos, videos, and more,” says Plaia. “It’s really changed the game for us and has become a great tool for attracting new families.” “I saved three to four thousand dollars switching to SportsEngine, and got much more robust tools than I had before,” says Plaia. “Our goal is to minimize the cost to play sports and increase the number of athletes — with a reasonable pricing structure and an online presence that motivates people to join us, SportsEngine has allowed us to do both.” “I get excited about our future with SportsEngine and am always waiting to see what’s next,” says Plaia. “If you go with someone that has proven success like SportsEngine — with their credibility and financial backing — then you know there’s more great things to come.” “With all the new tools coming out and enhancements being made, SportsEngine continues to make life easier for me and our volunteers.”",

      "next_sentence_true": "From lawsuits to loss of funding for the negligent appointment of volunteers, requiring a thorough background check for applicants from an accredited background screening company can help lower the risk of injury to all parties involved.",
      "full": "Volunteers play a crucial role in the success of many nonprofits and recreational organizations. They donate their time for the betterment of their communities and often have a positive impact on those to whom they lend their time. Yet all too often, we come across headlines about volunteers who have violated a community’s trust and committed acts that have caused serious harm to those they were meant to be helping. Background checks are a necessary precaution for the protection of children and vulnerable populations, as well as for the organizations themselves. Organizations that fail to adopt the necessary steps to properly screen volunteers put the trust of their communities, sponsors, and patrons at risk. From lawsuits to loss of funding for the negligent appointment of volunteers, requiring a thorough background check for applicants from an accredited background screening company can help lower the risk of injury to all parties involved. As reported by the Legal Intelligencer, beware of ‘do-it-yourself’ internet searches and companies that provide instant results online. Screening an applicant without their consent is a violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA). Following the rules of the FCRA is a standard that is adhered to by reputable national background screening companies. Instant-result internet companies that offer background screening services can also put organizations at risk by not providing accurate or up-to-date information which could result in applicants who might have a questionable past, passing a sub-standard check. When searching for a background screening provider, it is critical to know the process that is used to verify the identity of the applicant. Running a background check based solely on an applicant’s name is not only negligent but dangerous as incorrect name matches can lead to false positives or false negatives. Credible background screening providers will use a social security trace to help verify the identity of all potential applicants. The first step in any comprehensive national screening program is a Social Security Verification. This verification process involves comparing all three identifiers (Name, Date of Birth, and Social Security Number) to ensure that the applicant has provided accurate information for the screening process. If the verification is confirmed, the process moves on. If not, the process should be stopped immediately until the potential problem is corrected. After the verification of identity has been confirmed, the next step is to identify all addresses that have been associated with the applicant’s name and social security number. This ensures that you and your vendor have all the data needed to make an intelligent decision on where you should start looking for possible criminal history. Without this step, it would be easy to assume that the applicant has spent most of their time at their current residence. However, if the person has just moved two months ago, you are only checking two months of their history and you would not be aware of this fact. Companies that offer instant results Unfiltered results and false positives Background Checks that cost $13.00 or less – inexpensive When a company says that a “National database is all that is needed” – County and Local searches are ALWAYS necessary In order for organizations to protect themselves, those they serve, and their volunteers, it is necessary to implement a clear policy on background check procedures. Providing the right information in an easy to understand format will make your applicants feel more at ease and will allow them to understand what personal information is required of them and what will be done with that personal information. Privacy and identity theft are of great concern for many volunteer applicants which is why it is so important to conduct your screenings through a secure, accredited background screening company. Applicants should feel that their personal information is secure and the best way to do this is by employing a credible agency.

      "full": "The Safe Sport Act, which expands existing mandated youth abuse reporting laws and requires abuse awareness training for youth sports organizations, comes in response to the recent abuse scandals that have shaken the youth sports world. The National Center for Safety Initiatives (NCSI, and a subsidiary of SportsEngine, Inc.) has been at the forefront of helping to shape policy and recommended guidelines in the advancement of youth sports safety for over 15 years. As a result, NCSI followed the February 2018 passing of the <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/senate-bill/534/text?format=txt\"Protecting Young Victims from Sexual Abuse and Safe Sport Authorization Act of 2017</a with intense interest. The Safe Sport Act, which expands existing mandated youth abuse reporting laws and requires abuse awareness training for youth sports organizations, comes in response to the recent abuse scandals that have shaken the youth sports world. One of the areas of ambiguity with the new law is the lack of communication surrounding it. There are likely officials running youth sports organizations who aren’t even aware of its passing. Others are, understandably, confused as to what it means to them or how they should proceed to be in compliance. To that end, we sat down with NCSI’s team of experts for a Q&A that, hopefully, answers many of the questions associated with the passing of the Safe Sport Act. That’s a really good question. If you are affiliated with a national governing body, for example, USA Gymnastics or any other United States Olympic Committee sport, you report underneath a national governing body, and they will have their specific, what they call Safe Sport directives, that you need to follow. So if you are a USA Volleyball affiliate you are required to follow the USA Volleyball protocols. No, this is in conjunction with this act. Most of the organizations had at least some level of Safe Sport compliance or requirements for their volunteers and coaches. However, in February 2018, when the Safe Sport Act was enacted, this made it a requirement for everyone from the USOC-sanctioned national governing bodies all the way down to Babe Ruth baseball organizations. They are all required to follow the same type of protocols, not necessarily the same type of processes. It does. Because you have adults working with youth. And even though you do not have an affiliation with a national governing body or do not have any international or interstate travel, the requirement still does say that you need to follow the Safe Sport act requirements, which include abuse awareness training and, the biggest change, which is the mandatory reporting aspect of it. According to what the Safe Sport Act says, if you see or hear a report of any form of abuse, whether it is sexual, physical, mental or any other type of abuse you are required to report that abuse within a 24-hour period. The Safe Sport Act expands the list of individuals required to report child sexual abuse. Now, it is any adult who is authorized to interact with youth athletes will be required to report suspicions of abuse to the appropriate law enforcement agencies within 24 hours. The Act requires organizations to provide a “mechanism for communication” for all participants and volunteers where they can confidentially report incidents of abuse or suspicion of abuse. (Individuals and organizations) are not in adherence to the mandatory reporting requirements of the Act, and there could be criminal or civil charges. Yes. You are now required to go through abuse prevention training of some sort. There are many different organizations that do it. One is the <a href=\"https://safesport.org/who-we-are\"U.S. Center for Safe Sport</a, which this law is named after. Another is (<a href=\"http://www.ncsisafe.com/\"National Center for Safety Initiatives</a partner) <a href=\"https://www.d2l.org/\"Darkness to Light</a. And another one of our partners is <a href=\"https://abusepreventionsystems.com/\"Abuse Prevention Systems</a. So a type of training like that, where your coaches, parents, and volunteers are going to be able to go through and get the proper training, is required by law. Many organizations have already implemented background screening and concussion protocol. Now they will need to expand their safety resources and eligibility requirements by implementing the abuse and awareness training. It’s another addition to coaches’ required education. You still need to do a comprehensive <a href=\"https://www.sportsengine.com/solutions/background-checks/\"background check</a. It is an absolute must at all levels – the bare minimum of due diligence. It is part of this safety package, if you will, that is going to help ensure that your organization is doing a couple of things. One, you are ensuring that you are getting the right coaches, the ones who should be there, with the right character. Once they get in there, you are now going to train those individuals to be on the lookout for these other incidents. That combination is going to be a very comprehensive abuse prevention strategy, as opposed to a safety strategy. That’s the goal, to prevent the incidents that we have all heard in the news from happening again. No, not as of yet. There are some states that do require a background check. Pennsylvania is an example of a state that makes it a requirement. But there is no federal law that says a background check is required to coach youth sports or be in charge of minors in a youth sports environment. Most do as part of their abuse prevention strategy. Regular meetings might be a little much. We all know how hard it is to get people to come to these meetings. I would say on a bi-annual basis you should be reviewing your abuse prevention strategy, making sure as an organization you are in compliance. You should be working with an organization like <a href=\"https://www.sportsengine.com/solutions/safety/\"SportsEngine</a or <a href=\"http://www.ncsisafe.com/\"NCSI</a or the U.S. Center for Safe Sport to make sure you are in compliance. That is the best way to go. Because the documentation and document management that goes through this – that’s where your success is going to be found. You need to be able to track all of your coaches who have gone through this specific training and have gone through abuse prevention strategies. So if you are ever asked, “Are you doing these things?” you can very easily say yes, here are all the coaches who were rostered, here is everyone who has completed the training and here are the dates they completed said training. Because it is new, ask questions. Ask lots of questions like, What does this mean for us? How do I get this implemented? What does it mean to implement this? Is it going to be very complicated? Those are the things you are certainly going to have questions about. Organizations like SportsEngine, that are familiar with what is happening, and can get everything set up, are out there. Ask for help. This might seem like a daunting thing for coaches and a daunting thing for organizations to implement. But if you are implementing these abuse prevention strategies, one of them being background screening, another being abuse prevention training, you are going to have much more well-rounded coaches. They are going to understand the process. They are going to understand what needs to be done and how it needs to be done. Because of that, you are going to have educated parents. These parents want and need to see that you as an organization are doing everything possible to ensure that their kids are in a safe environment. After doing this for 15 years, working with organizations, we have seen a massive increase in organizations that are putting their safety programs, their abuse prevention programs out on the front page of their website because the moms and the dads that are out there are watching the same news we are watching. They are seeing that these things are happening, and they want to make sure that you as an organization are doing whatever is possible to prevent them. So advertise it. Don’t hide your abuse prevention programs in the back of your website where no one can find it. Put it out in the front. Moms and dads are going to see it and be encouraged by it. Families trust board leadership and organizations to find volunteers and coaches that create fun, educational, and safe environments for their athletes. In partnership with NSCI and SportsEngine protects athletes and organizations by thoroughly investigating all screening subjects through a variety of databases and search parameters.

That's why we're excited to announce some new features that are sure to delight administrators and parents alike. Now, bills can be paid online via checking or savings account. This is especially valuable for businesses that may be sponsoring your organization as many still prefer to pay bills with a check. We've also upgraded PowerPay reports so you can see the bills in a particular status (like overdue) or full transaction details. Pay bills with checking/savings account Bill status reports Transaction reports  <source srcset=\"/sites/default/files/images/NewBankAccountChecking.jpg 1x\" media=\"(min-width: 0px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\">                   <img src=\"/sites/default/files/images/NewBankAccountChecking.jpg\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" alt=\"New Bank Account Checking\" loading=\"lazy\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\">    </p  </div>          </article> </div>  <p class=\"large\">As the sponsorship coordinator for a youth hockey association, PowerPay has been a lifesaver. I now use a single system to create and send bills, accept payments, and get a snapshot of all the outstanding sponsorship payments. We've also used it to collect \"level up\" fee differences. But a common issue we've run into is the need to pay by check. Now, PowerPay allows anyone to pay a bill with a checking or savings account.  <source srcset=\"/sites/default/files/images/OverdueBillsScreenshotSmall.png 1x\" media=\"(min-width: 0px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"250\" height=\"183\">                   <img src=\"/sites/default/files/images/OverdueBillsScreenshotSmall.png\" width=\"250\" height=\"183\" alt=\"Overdue Bills Screenshot Small\" loading=\"lazy\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\">    </p  </div>          </article> </div>  <p class=\"large\">On a weekly basis, I check in to see the status of bills. Generally, I'm looking to see bills that are overdue so I can reach out to anyone with a gentle reminder (outside of the automatic ones they are receiving). Now, PowerPay allows you to show bills in any particular status: credited, overdue, paid, partially paid, partially refunded, refunded, unpaid, and voided.  <source srcset=\"/sites/default/files/images/TransactionsScreenshot.png 1x\" media=\"(min-width: 0px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"628\" height=\"308\">                   <img src=\"/sites/default/files/images/TransactionsScreenshot.png\" width=\"628\" height=\"308\" alt=\"Transactions Screenshot\" loading=\"lazy\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\">    </p  </div>          </article> </div>  <p class=\"large\">If you want to see all transactions that have been made through PowerPay, you can do that in the new Transactions section. This is really valuable if you want to see what's happened in the past week, or get additional details to help someone who has had a payment fail. For example, you can see details like 'verification code was invalid'. To bring your organization to SportsEngine or to learn more about how you can use PowerPay, start by scheduling a chat with a SportsEngine expert through our Get Started form: sportsengine.com/get-started",

      "next_sentence_true": "“It’s not like I have a spare 10 hours a month – especially during fall when registration is happening,” Draper said.",
      "full": "“When I broke down and reached out to him I realized how much of a rock star he is and how he can help us.” The life of a hockey parent is hectic at best. Between the odd-hour practices, emergency skate sharpenings and weekend-consuming tournaments, it’s not uncommon for parents to look to each other – and just about everywhere else – to lighten the load. Kelli Draper knows this all too well. The mother of two was already balancing her sons’ hockey schedules with her career in the technology industry and her family’s non-hockey activities before taking on the treasurer and webmaster duties at the Alexandria (Minnesota) Area Hockey Association. “I didn’t grow up anywhere near hockey, it’s something my kids got into from their cousins,” Draper said. “The more my kids loved it the more I decided it was time to give back, but I felt a little like a fish out of water.” Giving back meant finally agreeing to volunteer her time and technology expertise as treasurer at AAHA after declining the role for several months. Draper quickly learned that she, like the previous treasurer, would also take on the registration duties. In all, the role required about 10 to 15 hours of attention per month. Given her professional background in testing and purchasing applications, Draper was more than capable of performing the duties – once she found the time to do so. “It’s not like I have a spare 10 hours a month – especially during fall when registration is happening,” Draper said. “My older son is really into cross country, and my younger son also does football.” When Draper took the role, the Alexandria Area Hockey Association had only been using SportsEngine technology for one season and wasn’t maximizing the full potential of the platform. Users were given the option of registering via the SportsEngine website or offline. Draper said nearly 85 percent opted to pay offline – a portion of which paid in monthly installments. Dealing with offline payments added greatly to Draper’s workload as each check she received meant another trip to the bank, another set of paperwork to file and another balance to keep an eye on. After a time-consuming first year as treasurer and registrar, Draper talked to the AAHA board and webmaster/public relations and communications volunteer Michelle Russell about moving the registration process entirely online. The board agreed, and Russell suggested they contact SportsEngine senior account manager Brandon Holtz to help with the switch. “When I first started, I was trying to figure everything out on my own even though Brandon had already emailed me,” Russell said. “My questions were about how to whittle down to a specific user group within the entire association. I finally reached out to him, and he put together a video within an hour, sent it to me and I was blown away.” On Russell’s advice, Draper reached out to Holtz and explained her pain points regarding the registration process. After the initial phone call, Holtz, one of SportsEngne’s 24 account managers, began working with Draper on designing a new registration model that would encourage users to pay online and alleviate Draper’s workload. While SportsEngine provides expert-level technical support, Holtz’s role as an account manager is more like that of a consultant than technician. Account managers collaborate with all of SportsEngine’s departments to keep up with best practices and the intricacies of new products. Holtz said his primary goal is to advocate for his customers and make sure the SportsEngine platform is optimized for them. “We are essentially small business consultants for youth sports,” Holtz said. “We align ourselves as experts in the sports business industry and try to make that volunteer role that these parents have taken on as efficient and easy as possible.” Draper said Holtz was patient and helpful throughout the redesign and responded to her emails quickly and with several options. Holtz also gave Draper and Russell the tools and knowledge to better use the SportsEngine platform and serve their association. Draper and Holtz’s new registration model has been in place for two years, and the organization’s registration is entirely online, except for a few special cases. Draper’s job is now largely hands-free as she monitors the registration process through reports and no longer deals with bounced checks and piles of paperwork. “Honestly, I cannot say enough good things,” Draper said. “Coming from this industry, I’ve worked with a ton of application vendors, and this was the easiest process.” While Russell and Draper have had nothing but fruitful interactions with Holtz, Russell admitted that she was reluctant to reach out at first. “When I broke down and reached out to him I realized how much of a rock star he is and how he can help us,” Russell said. Russell, an eight-year AAHA member, has used advice from Holtz to make communication between the association and its community more efficient and to help new hockey parents better use the association’s website. Like Draper, she balances her professional and family life with her AAHA role, has limited time to spare and greatly appreciates anything that can make her duties easier. “The association relies on SportsEngine for all of our information, so it’s crucial we know how to use it,” Russell said. “Every organization can improve on communication, and if they understand what is going on and why, people will have a good experience with the association.” Holtz, married and a father of three, understands the time crunch of being a parent and the importance of communication. As an account manager, he draws heavily on his background in sports and business development to put himself in the shoes of his clients. “In the media relations role, you are a connecter in the background,” Holtz said. “You want to help people get where they are going. I like being that person in the background, getting things set up and helping them achieve goals.”",

      "full": "Jeff Lockhart handles webmaster duties for massive Fargo-based youth hockey association Name: Jeff Lockhart Site: Fargo Youth Hockey Association Position: Hockey Operations Manager Use of platform: Dibs, League, Sitebuilder, Registration, Tourney, Verify Background: You would think a northern Minnesota guy whose career has had him immersed in hockey every day for the last 10 years would have a deep hockey background. You would be wrong. Lockhart grew up in the rare “State of Hockey” town so small (Ulen: population 547) that there was no hockey program to join. So he played basketball. “But I probably would have been better at hockey if I had played it,” Lockhart said. He was introduced to the inner workings of hockey program management by his wife, Sommer, who serves as Fargo Youth Hockey’s Tournament & Sales Director. She previously worked at the glitzy Ralph Engelstad Arena in Grand Forks, North Dakota, before the family moved to Fargo. When Lockhart isn’t knee deep in skates, sticks and pucks, he still helps his dad work the family farm. What he does: Among dozens of other duties, Lockhart handles the scheduling for the Fargo Youth Hockey Association. Luckily for Lockhart, Fargo’s Teamsters Ice Arena is owned by the association, giving Lockhart a good start for slotting practices and games for one of the Midwest’s largest youth hockey associations (more than 1,000 players are on a combined 90 boys’ and girls’ teams) outside of the Twin Cities. Once he has exhausted the ice time at his home rink, Lockhart starts booking available slots at most of the other dozen or so ice sheets in the Fargo metro area, where hockey is something of a boom sport. Lockhart said Fargo Youth Hockey has grown by 46 percent since 2009. There were 229 kids in the Introduction to Hockey program this fall. Lockhart recently oversaw a redesign of the association’s website, which corresponded with a transition to a mobile responsive theme. He uses SportsEngine integration partner MaxGalaxy for his scheduling software. He built a Teamsters Arena page that shows the arena’s schedule in an iframe embedded by using the Code page element. Making his mark: The Tournaments landing page includes a Table Builder page element that lists every 2017 tournament hosted by the association, 15 of them in all. The page also includes guidelines for the various age group divisions and links to registration for the tournaments that still have openings.",

      "full": "Chris Steele, who originally hoped to land a secretary position with the Colleyville Heritage High School football team's booster club, instead has thrived as webmaster despite a 'trial by fire' initiation. Name: Chris Steele Site: Colleyville Heritage High School Football Position: Webmaster Use of platform: Registration, Sitebuilder Background: Steele grew up in Houston, attended the University of North Texas in the Dallas/Fort Worth area and settled in nearby Colleyville to raise her family. She is a high school English teacher by training, but spends most of her time as a stay-at-home mom. She works as a substitute teacher on occasion, and last spring volunteered to serve as a volunteer with the Colleyville Heritage High School football program’s booster club. She initially hoped to land the open secretary position, but when that was filled, “The booster club president said, ‘Hey, would you mind doing this instead?’ ” Steele said. “This” meant stepping in and taking over the club’s webmaster duties. “I had no website experience, so it was trial by fire,” Steele said. “The previous person who did it was our booster club president (Dean Jones). He said, ‘Oh, just get in there and play around, you’ll figure it out.’ ” Steele’s oldest son, Brendan, played on Colleyville Heritage's Junior Varsity Black squad this fall while middle son, Taylor, played on the Freshman Black team. What she does: Steele laughs about, “Using my masters degree for a website.” But she has proven to be a quick study when it comes to learning the SportsEngine platform. She effectively uses a wide variety of page elements in multiple ways, most noticeably on the football program’s home page. Steele said she takes direction from Colleyville Heritage’s head coach Joe Willis and current booster club president Ryan Young on what content to present on the home page and how to prioritize it. “It’s a joint effort between everybody looking at things,” said Steele, adding she gets help updating the site, particularly calendar items, from assistant coach Freddy Ortega. The Panthers, who play in the second largest of Texas’ football classifications (Class 5A), reached the third round of the playoffs before being eliminated in a wild 80-62 loss to Lubbock Coronado on Dec. 2 at Wildcat Stadium in Abilene. Before that game, Steele had the site’s homepage loaded with information about the game, including directions, ticket prices, a countdown timer to kickoff and what fans were allowed to bring into the stadium. The detail-oriented Steele created a Coaches section with photos and bio information, loaded player photos on the team’s roster and kept the team’s schedule updated with results. Making her mark: Steele created a Recruiting Page that includes a Prospect Guide that lists players from the 2018 through 2021 classes who are looking to play at the college level. There’s a photo with each player, and basic stats (height, weight, 40-yard dash time) are also listed. Steele also provides links to each player’s Twitter and HUDL pages. Fun fact: Colleyville Heritage quarterback Jagger LaRoe threw for 508 yards and four touchdowns in the playoff loss to Lubbock Coronado.  The teams combined for 1,440 yards of offense and 20 touchdowns.",

      "full": "Monday night will be the third New Year’s Eve celebration at the Marriott Syracuse Downtown since the former Hotel Syracuse was brought back to grandeur. The hotel opened in 1924, closed in 2004, and reopened in August 2016 after a $76 million renovation. The hotel is again an employer for hundreds, an elegant building where visitors enjoy Syracuse at its most gracious, a place to gather for fun, and the site for grand and cherished events. Ed Riley was the renovation’s driving force, though he defers accolades to many others. He is one of the partners in Hotel Syracuse Restoration LLC, the company that brought the building back to life when plenty of naysayers had given up. Riley is a fourth-generation Syracuse native whose family moved to Camillus when he was a youngster. Riley spent most of his career in the hotel and resort business, the last nine years of it with the Pyramid Hotel Group in a Boston skyscraper. He was in charge of restoring distressed hotels from coast to coast and beyond, but Riley had never moved from CNY. At age 60, he left Pyramid Hotel Group to lead restoration of his hometown’s treasured landmark. <b>What do you hope people experience here on New Year&#x27;s Eve? </b> First, let’s not look just at New Year’s Eve. We’ve added other events so folks come and experience the hotel. The St. Patrick’s Parade day is a big one. We have block parties before SU football games. I think one of the most successful events is a small one before the tree-lighting ceremony in Clinton Square. It’s turned out to be extremely gratifying. We have the lobby open and serve cookies, we have caroling, we have dance exhibitions going on in the Persian Terrace, kids visit Santa, and families see the hotel decked out for the holidays. Then they can go to the tree lighting. It&#x27;s not driving a tremendous amount of business per se, but we want the community to come here, celebrate with us, and enjoy this building that&#x27;s been here for 90-some years. <b>OK, so the hotel has special events, community events, parties, and celebrations all year long. </b> Absolutely. Even in terms of the weddings, we have legacy weddings. A couple months ago, we had a legacy wedding where the bride and groom&#x27;s grandparents and parents, and now the bride and groom all had their celebration here. So it&#x27;s those types of things that continue through the generations that are so important to us to celebrate. It was said to me a long time ago that the hotel is the vault where Syracuse keeps its memories. We’re trying to build a lot more memories. <b>Were you in leadership roles growing up? </b> I always liked a leadership position, starting in sports. I&#x27;m not afraid of it. Getting out there, testing the waters and pushing the envelope has been something I&#x27;ve enjoyed. I grew up in Syracuse and Camillus. I went to Holy Family School on the west side. Also went to CBA and OCC and SU. I was a football player in high school, at CBA (Class of 1972), and before that in Pop Warner. I was fortunate enough to play quarterback. I also played basketball, not so much on a high school team, but in the old CYO league. And lacrosse – I was on one of the first teams at CBA and was fortunate enough my senior year to be elected a captain. So yes, I’ve always embraced working with people, being interactive with people, and getting people motivated to do things, getting them excited about the task at hand. How are <i><u>we</u></i> going to solve this problem? How are <i><u>we</u></i> going to deal with it? Growing up, it’s something we just seemed to do in my neighborhood. I remember early on when a group of us got together and built a small baseball diamond in a vacant field. The gentleman that owned the land let us do it, and some adults helped out, but basically the kids created it. We did a lot of things together as a neighborhood, and it was really a joint effort of people working together. <b>Is that field still there? </b> It’s probably gone by now. (Laughter) A lot of things have developed up around it. <b>College? </b> I started out as a math education major for two semesters at Syracuse and then switched over to architecture. I transferred to OCC for architectural technology then went back to SU for the School of Architecture. I worked at the city Parks Department for many years, starting out as a basket person at the various pools. Eventually, I worked up to pool manager and then regional manager for pools in the city of Syracuse Parks Department. <b>What advice would you give to be an effective leader? </b> Listen. Listen. And listen. Use the talents that are around you. Listen to the people around you. Get them engaged. Get them excited. But listen to what people are saying to you. Some leaders do too much talking <i><u>at</u></i> people and not enough listening to what their ideas are. Once you listen, incorporate ideas, take the value that people are adding to an assignment, a project, whatever it is. Take that, really embrace it, incorporate it, and give credit back. Giving credit is such a huge encouragement to people. <b>It&#x27;s probably obvious, but how does giving credit encourage people? </b> Remember your days in sports? If you make a good play and everyone on your team sort of congratulates you, it makes you work that much harder to do another good play. The same thing can be said in any endeavor, whether it&#x27;s a business transaction or something else that you&#x27;re involved in. It can be as simple as saying nice job. It doesn&#x27;t have to be a million-dollar prize. You can say: I really appreciate the effort you did on that. You went the extra mile to make it happen. Thanks. Thanks. That encouragement goes miles to that person, to make them feel like they can solve a problem, do something constructive, and encourage them to do it the next time. It lets them think about expanding what their role is. <b>Give me an example of how you show your appreciation. </b> Here, we try to show our appreciation both on a regular disciplined way and in a less formal way. On a monthly basis, we bring the associates in and congratulate an associate or a couple of different associates for outstanding achievements that are put on the table by their peers or in letters we get from guests and/or groups that have stayed here and said this person did an outstanding job. We bring that up to the entire staff to reinforce it and say: Look, this is what it means to us. This is part of our success. We do it on a regular, disciplined basis. It&#x27;s part of reinforcing our culture. On a less formal basis, it’s as easy as going to somebody on the waitstaff that has done an excellent job because a guest stops me and says: You know, I went to a wedding last weekend and everything was great, but this one person who was waiting on our table, she did a great job. So it’s finding them and saying: I heard this from a guest. You did a great job. Thank you very much. They want to book other things here. <b>I have heard people say they are too busy to seek someone out to say thank you or to share a compliment.</b> As a leader, if you don&#x27;t make time to do that and encourage people around you, then you&#x27;re not doing your job. You have to be disciplined enough to say: The people that I&#x27;m leading are in this boat with me, and they deserve to understand their worth, to understand what they&#x27;re contributing. And they also understand where they can go, that they’re not just captive in one area. That they <i><u>can</u></i> do other things, and they are encouraged to make decisions and also to take chances. The easiest way to get a person not to lead is to punish them if they take chances and fail. Why would I stick my neck out again? Sometimes the greatest teacher is failure. Leadership is about learning and teaching. Too often, leaders either beat people up or make it a negative experience when something doesn&#x27;t quite come out the way everyone thought it should. They do that instead of using it as a teaching moment. If you keep repeating the same mistake over and over, then that has to be corrected. But you can learn a lot from something that doesn&#x27;t go quite right. <b>Tell me about a time in your career when listening, giving credit, and having the discipline you talked about led to a success. </b> To somewhat of a degree, getting this hotel done and back for the community was that type of an endeavor. We put together a group of people that got together for breakfast every Monday morning for a long time. We started with the city of Syracuse and Onondaga County and their representatives. Every time somebody put a problem on the table or we had a setback, we all put our heads together to figure out how we could move the ball forward. I mean, we could have just thrown the towel in. But the different people around the table basically said: Look, why don&#x27;t we try this? Then, bringing on The Hayner Hoyt Corp. and Gary Thurston to get the costing done and working with them and saying: OK, we can’t afford that, but what can we afford and what can we get into here to make it work? So it was a really a lot of melded people that came together with different ideas, different set of skills and were encouraged to put ideas on the table regardless of how far-fetched they sounded. We wanted to hear them because maybe it was the one that made the least sense at one time that got utilized, that got us over the hump. That&#x27;s what happened here. This is not a one-person deal. This is a lot of people pulling oars in the same direction.",

Therefore, this year, I have chosen four shows from only two professional companies -- Syracuse Stage and Cortland Repertory Theatre -- for exquisite quality, choice of material, and artistic execution. <i>Syracuse Stage/Michael Davis</i> <b>&quot;A Raisin in the Sun&quot; (Syracuse Stage)</b> Curulla: Set in a cramped, run-down apartment on the southside of Chicago in the period between the horrors of Jim Crow America and the Civil Rights Movement, Lorraine Hansberry&#x27;s iconic play teems with unbridled anger and frustration for the Younger family as it attempts to escape its seemingly inexorable fate of poverty and stasis. Framed by Tony Cisek&#x27;s evocative, single-set design of the apartment&#x27;s interior, the stage&#x27;s back wall, wings, and fly space were filled by sprawling, black balconies and staircases creating an urban exterior that reflected the situation of a family on the brink of escape. This masterful, dramatic tour-de-force, sensitively directed by Timothy Douglas in association with Indiana Repertory Theatre, and played by a stunning ensemble, was punctuated with moments of poignancy, heartfelt humor, anger, and outrage that served to underscore its overriding humanity. Read the review <i>Kerby Thompson</i> <b>&quot;Saturday Night Fever&quot; (Cortland Repertory Theatre)</b> Curulla: The audience (as was I) was fully engaged in the sounds, the rhythms, and the movements dictated by the seeming timelessness of the infectious Bee Gee score in this stage version of the 1977 film starring a young John Travolta. Despite the minimal scenic design (an intelligent choice by director Kerby Thompson, given the relatively tight space necessarily reserved for some monster footwork), the visuals paid off anyway with interesting, period costuming and evocative lighting. The relatively thin storyline centered around Tony Manero (Michael Russell), a Brooklyn teenager who is just another cog in the wheel by day, but king of the local disco by night, is rescued by the great score pumped out by an eight-piece orchestra and the &quot;large&quot;  choreography by the principals and dance ensemble. Read the review <i>Eric Behnke</i> <b>&quot;Our Town&quot; (Cortland Repertory Theatre)</b> Curulla: Cortland Repertory Theatre&#x27;s production, directed by Kerby Thompson, was stunning in its simplicity&#x27;s ability to extract the universal from the individual while fulfilling Thornton Wilder&#x27;s (playwright) intention of showing the value in everyday life. Framed around the lives of two specific families in early 20th century New Hampshire, the spartan language and attitudes about life propel the play&#x27;s meaning from microcosm to macrocosm, and simplicity to complexity, creating an archetype for life lived anywhere at any time. Thus, the play&#x27;s teetering between a timeliness and timelessness has yet to be matched by any subsequent stage property. Replete with theater &quot;anti-conventions&quot; such as a stage manager character &quot;breaking the fourth wall&quot; to address the audience and characters communicating movement through pantomime, the play plumbs the depths of relationships that are deftly acted and devoid of exaggeration or hyperbole. One of the notable aspects of this production was the director&#x27;s preciseness in casting. All characters, right down to the minor citizenry, were age-appropriate, eliminating the need for utilizing extensive make-up or ill-fitting costumes as I have witnessed in some productions. Read the review <i>Michael Davis</i> <b>&quot;Elf&quot; (Syracuse Stage/SU Drama)</b> Curulla:  OK, I know, what the heck was I thinking? Considering &quot;Elf,&quot; a frothy, silly, Christmas adventure tale based on an even sillier movie that&#x27;s, ostensibly, more for kids than serious theater patrons, even including jaded reviewers? Maybe I need to go back to reviewer school. Not so fast. M-G-M put out not one, but two films over four decades ago titled &quot;That&#x27;s Entertainment!&quot; And with good reason. One word --  entertainment. It&#x27;s one of the elements often avoided in critical discussions about works of art, and perhaps even more so when considering the theater. It&#x27;s supposed to be the serious actor&#x27;s real playground. It&#x27;s where they work without a net. No second or third takes or editing. It&#x27;s do or die. And that&#x27;s why I choose &quot;Elf&quot; as one of my favorites for this year. I choose &quot;Elf&quot; to remind us all (even myself) that, above all, theater can entertain as well as inform, enrich, provoke thought, change minds, or even make us better human beings. It was just plain entertaining. It pandered neither to a snooty sophistication and cynicism about Christmas and the Holidays, nor did it stoop to a dumbing down to an elementary school vision to please the kiddies and bore the rest of us. In this &quot;searching-for-roots&quot;-themed journey, we follow Buddy the Elf (Chris Stevens) as he leaves the North Pole for New York City in search of his real father. Fraught with interesting characters along the way, the show was littered with clever one-liners, seasoned with double-entendre, and numerous sight gags. In addition, the movement was precise with several numbers including Broadway-style dance lines juxtaposed to the whacky, unpredictable, yet fluid, movement of Stevens&#x27; character. This annual holiday collaboration between the pros at Syracuse Stage and the students and faculty of the Syracuse University  Department of Drama was directed by Donna Drake and choreographed by faculty member Brian J. Marcum. Read the review <b>Linda Lowen</b> A little background before I reveal my choices; bear with me, it&#x27;s relevant. I once had a conversation with a friend -- an upbeat guy prone to periods of melancholy -- who told me, &quot;I&#x27;m a dark person on a happy path.&quot; &quot;That&#x27;s funny. I&#x27;m the exact opposite.&quot; I&#x27;d never thought much about it, but as I said those words, I realized I was being honest. &quot;I&#x27;m a happy person on a dark path.&quot; My inclination as a theatergoer, moviegoer, and reader is to head for that dark part of the woods, because those paths lead to stories that strive to define truths. The fact is, it&#x27;s easier to pull off drama, much harder to do comedy. So when I looked back over 2018 for the best of CNY theater, I surprised myself. There was virtually no competition for the top three spots which were all lighthearted shows. <i>Ron Heerkens Jr / Goat Factory </i> <b>&quot;Anne of Green Gables&quot; (Finger Lakes Musical Theatre Festival)</b> Lowen:  Introduced as &quot;a new folk rock musical,&quot; &quot;Anne&quot; made it onstage at the Merry-Go-Round Theatre this past July through FLMTF&#x27;s musical theater incubator program &quot;The Pitch&quot;; a still-in-development version was performed in 2017 at the Carriage House Theater behind the Cayuga Museum. While this may have been FLMTF&#x27;s biggest risk of the 2018 summer season, they chose wisely. The musical was exuberant, uplifting, unexpectedly fresh (the story is based on a 1908 children&#x27;s book by Canadian author Lucy Maud Montgomery), and thematically relevant, with catchy pop songs that beg for a future Broadway cast album. I described it as &quot;lightning in a jar&quot; and &quot;a vibrant, sparkling and startlingly joyous production&quot;; hands down it was the best show of the season.",

On Monday, the Oscar-winning actor reintroduced himself with an odd video amid news that he would face criminal charges in a 2016 case of alleged sexual assault. The Boston Globe reported Monday that Spacey was scheduled for arraignment on a charge of indecent assault and battery at Nantucket District Court on Jan. 7. The incident in question took place in July 2016 and allegedly involved the actor groping the genitals of an unwilling 18-year-old. Spacey raised eyebrows Monday with his ill-fated return to social media for the first time since his apology to Anthony Rapp and official statement coming out as a gay man in October 2017. On Twitter and Instagram, the “Usual Suspects” actor shared a link to a YouTube video featuring Spacey delivering a three-minute monologue in character as his former “House of Cards” protagonist, Frank Underwood.",

      "full": "SYRACUSE -- Columbus Baking Co. on Pearl Street opens at 6 a.m. on Christmas Eve every year. The first customer usually arrives at about 5:30 a.m. It was no different this morning. “It’s the busiest day of the year, and people don’t want to miss out getting their bread,” owner Jimmy Retzos said as he cut the freshly risen dough. “It’s never enough. You try to satisfy all the customers. All we can do is do our best.” From 6 a.m. to about 9 a.m., a steady flow of people walks through the door to buy flat Italian bread or the softer sandwich loaf for $2.75 each. By 9 a.m., though, the traffic jams start. People vie for parking spots around the block, and once they finally snag one, they jockey for their spot in line. It often stretches around the corner, but the turnover is quick. Customers might wait 10-15 minutes to finally get inside. Columbus will probably go through 6,000 loaves of bread, based on previous years, about four to fives times a typical day. “Last year I got here and they were out of bread,” said Cindy Strong of Baldwinsville. “I made sure that doesn’t happen this year.” Lauren and Duke Johnson of Saratoga Springs brought their twin 1-year-old daughters -- Nora and Avery -- to the fun. They left with a mix of 13 loaves and some fresh dough. “My dad used to always stop and bring Columbus bread home,” Lauren Johnson said. “I’m continuing the tradition.” Columbus is open until 2 p.m., and it will be open at 6 a.m. Christmas morning.

      "next_sentence_true": "She and Sweat have both denied a physical relationship, but Mitchell -- who has not seen any episodes of “Escape at Dannemora” -- said Stiller and Arquette don’t care about the truth.",
      "full": "Joyce “Tillie” Mitchell is not happy with the new Showtime series “Escape at Dannemora.” The former prison seamstress, now behind bars herself for helping two convicted killers escape from the Dannemora prison in 2015, tells The New York Post that she believes much of the Ben Stiller-directed TV show is “lies.” “I never had sex with them,” she said in a jailhouse interview conducted last week at Bedford Hills Correctional Facility in Westchester. “Ben Stiller is a son-of-a-bitch liar just like the rest of the world. He doesn’t care about the truth. All he cares about is making millions off me. He’s an idiot.” It’s the first time Mitchell has spoken publicly since 2015, when Richard Matt and David Sweat escaped from the Clinton Correctional Facility in Dannemora, N.Y., sparking a weeks-long manhunt across Upstate New York. Matt was shot dead and Sweat was shot and captured near the Canadian border. Mitchell admitted to the Post that she bought hacksaw blades for “99 cents at Walmart”, smuggling them into the prison for Matt and Sweat to help them escape. The TV series suggests she was in love with them, but she told the newspaper she only participated because she was scared of them. ‘I wish I could take it all back. If I had to do it over, I would have told somebody,&quot; Mitchell said. Oscar winner Patricia Arquette plays Mitchell in “Escape at Dannemora,” gaining 40 pounds for the role. In the series, she has sex with both Matt (played by Benicio Del Toro) and Sweat (Paul Dano) in a prison sewing shop storeroom where she worked. Mitchell told investigators she provided nude photos of herself to Sweat and claimed she was forced to give Matt oral sex. She and Sweat have both denied a physical relationship, but Mitchell -- who has not seen any episodes of “Escape at Dannemora” -- said Stiller and Arquette don’t care about the truth. “The truth doesn’t sell,” Mitchell told the Post. “Everyone thinks I’m just a whore who wanted it.” “Escape at Dannemora,” which filmed scenes at the real-life locations in Upstate New York, premiered on Showtime in November. The series, also starring Bonnie Hunt, David Morse, Michael Imperioli and Eric Lange, airs Sundays at 10 p.m. ET. The show has been nominated for two Golden Globe Awards: Best Television Limited Series or Motion Picture Made for Television, and Best Actress in a Limited Series or Motion Picture Made for Television for Arquette. Mitchell, who pleaded guilty to promoting prison contraband and facilitating criminal activity, has been denied parole twice. She’s sentenced to stay at Bedford Hills Correctional Facility through June 2022, but is next eligible for early release in June 2019. She told the Post that she looks forward to spending time with her family when she’s released, including in a new gazebo her husband Lyle Mitchell built for her. She also plans to write a book so “the truth will come out.” If you purchase a product or register for an account through a link on our site, we may receive compensation.

They began volunteering, twice a day, to go to Zelsnack’s 228-acre farm in Marathon and care for the family’s 100 beef cattle, about 40 sheep and 13 pigs and four chickens. As the weeks went on, firefighters from other places, such as Binghamton and Norwich, came to help, says Derek Reynolds, who’s worked with Zelsnack at the fire department for years. Zelsnack, 48, died at Upstate University Hospital on Dec. 21. The volunteer farm duty continues. Shifts are filled out into the new year, Reynolds said. “We’ve got firefighters coming to help a brother in need,” Reynolds said this evening. “It’s an amazing sight to see.” Reynolds said Zelsnack and his brother, Jim, had recently bought the fourth-generation family farm from their father. “He was a full-time firefighter and a full-time farmer,” Reynolds said of Steve. Zelsnack joined the Cortland fire department eight years ago where brother, Jim, is also a firefighter, Reynolds said. Steve’s son, Justin Zelsnack, is a firefighter in Binghamton. “Farming and firefighting run in the family,” Reynolds said. Reynolds said the final police report has not been issued from the accident, which happened at Route 41A and Sayles Corners Road in Sempronius. Shortly after the accident, state police said Zelsnack failed to stop his pickup truck at a stop sign and ran into a tractor trailer, the Auburn Citizen reported. The other driver was not injured. Friends are selling T-shirts to raise money and a fund has been set up for donations. Calling hours are from 10 a.m. to noon Dec. 29 at Saint Stephen’s Roman Catholic Church in Marathon, N.Y. A mass will follow. Reynolds said it was too early to say what the family’s long-term plans were at the farm. He said firefighters were planning to keep helping the Zelsnacks into the new year.",

      "full": "The year is coming to a close, but that doesn&#x27;t mean the party has to stop. Over the past two weeks, I hit a few bars in Syracuse in search of some high-end cocktails that&#x27;ll make you think you&#x27;re drinking in a big city. As usual, I picked up a few friends along the way. Watching the bartenders prepare the drinks is almost as fun as drinking them. (I said ALMOST!) <i>Charlie Miller | cmiller@syracuse.com</i> <b>The Smoking Pistol</b> Where: Otro Cinco, 206 S Warren St., downtown Syracuse Ingredients: Vida Mezcal, simple syrup, lime & bourbon cherry float Price: $10 Served in a rocks glass, this sweet cocktail packs a punch. Be careful. Tip: Make a reservation or you&#x27;ll be standing for a bit. That&#x27;s not necessarily a bad thing because the bar is oh-so-much fun. Plus the bartenders know what they&#x27;re doing, and they do it with a smile. <b>The Hustler</b> Where: Otro Cinco, 206 S Warren St., downtown Syracuse Ingredients: Silver tequila, triple sec, muddled jalapeños, lime juice and strawberry Price: $9 This is the signature cocktail of Otro. That shouldn&#x27;t come as a surprise. It&#x27;s a little sweet and a little spicy. It&#x27;ll make you think you&#x27;re someplace warmer. Tip: The house-made chips and salsa are the perfect munchie to accompany this fun drink. <i>Charlie Miller | cmiller@syracuse.com</i> <b>The Hustler</b> Tip: This goes really well with the paella. That gives you a built-in extra 30 minutes to enjoy a couple of these while the chef prepares your meal. <i>Charlie Miller | cmiller@syracuse.com</i> <b>We Bleed Orange</b> Where: The York, 247 W Fayette St. in Armory Square downtown Syracuse Ingredients: Single-barrel Patron Añejo tequila, Citronge liqueur, blood orange, lime and agave Price: $12 <i>Charlie Miller | cmiller@syracuse.com</i> <b>We Bleed Orange</b> The We Bleed Orange has always been a house favorite. Perhaps it&#x27;s the small-batch tequila that York gets special from Patron. Or maybe it&#x27;s the fun presentation in the colorful skull mug. &quot;It&#x27;s never been on the menu until now, but it&#x27;s always a huge seller,&quot; said York Owner Danny Vault. &quot;We put a lot of pride in our drinks here.&quot; Vault studied and worked in New York City restaurants for 12 years. He says he enjoys bringing a little of the city to his restaurant in Syracuse. The packed house on a Friday night seems to appreciate the effort. <i>Charlie Miller | cmiller@syracuse.com</i> <b>The Wise Guy</b> Where: Citronelle, 113 Walton St., in Syracuse&#x27;s Armory Square Ingredients: High West American Prairie bourbon, fresh citrus juice, egg froth, cranberry-cinnamon syrup, allspice, red wine float Price: $13 I originally thought the frothiness would be the highlight of The Wise Guy. I was wrong. What makes this drink so elegant is how so many different flavors come together. If you sip it -- a hard task in itself -- you can appreciate each one in a smooth texture. <i>Charlie Miller | cmiller@syracuse.com</i> <b>Smoked Manhattan</b> Where: Citronelle, 113 Walton St, downtown Syracuse Ingredients: Bourbon, sweet vermouth, Italian cherries Price: $13 Bartender Matt Sherlock starts by mixing the whiskey and vermouth in a shaker with ice. As it chills, he sets a wood chip (it can be applewood, maple, or a whiskey chip) on fire. <i>Charlie Miller | cmiller@syracuse.com</i> <b>Smoked Manhattan</b> He covers the burning chip with a rocks glass and lets the flame run out of oxygen. Once it smolders, smoke coats the inside of the glass. That leaves a noticeable but not overpowering smokiness behind. <i>Charlie Miller | cmiller@syracuse.com</i> <b>Smoked Manhattan</b> After a few stirs with the stainless steel spoon, in goes the liquor. <i>Charlie Miller | cmiller@syracuse.com</i> <b>Smoked Manhattan</b> This is a delightful twist on the classic Manhattan. The smoke actually brings out the complexities of high-end bourbon. It doesn&#x27;t take over. Going back to a plain old Manhattan might be challenging. <i>Charlie Miller</i> <b>Cranberry Mule</b> Where: Citronelle, 113 Walton St, downtown Syracuse Ingredients: Cranberry-infused vodka, fresh cranberry puree, lime, ginger, ginger beer Price: $13 <i>Charlie Miller | cmiller@syracuse.com</i> <b>Cranberry Mule</b> The mule seems to be a popular cocktail this holiday season. And it&#x27;s no surprise. The bartenders at Citronelle say it&#x27;s among the most popular drinks over the past few weeks. <i>Charlie Miller | cmiller@syracuse.com</i> <b>Boulevardier</b> Where: Citronelle, 113 Walton St, downtown Syracuse Ingredients: Bourbon, sweet vermouth, and Campari Price: $13 <i>Charlie Miller | cmiller@syracuse.com</i> <b>Boulevardier</b> This is basically a Negroni with bourbon instead of gin. <i>Charlie Miller | cmiller@syracuse.com</i> <b>Boulevardier</b> While it&#x27;s still on the bitter side, the bourbon joins the vermouth to make a sweeter drink. <i>Charlie Miller | cmiller@syracuse.com</i> <b>Caramel Apple Martini</b> Where: Kelley&#x27;s Restaurant & Bar, 5076 Velasko Road, Syracuse Ingredients: 2 ounces Smirnoff caramel vodka, 1 ounce  butterscotch schnapps, 2 ounces Beak & Skiff apple cider and caramel topping. Price: $9 This bar just outside the city limits rotates its specialty cocktail menu. This sweet cocktail captures the taste of autumn heading into winter. Sarah the bartender starts by lining the martini glass with caramel sauce as the rest chills. A careful pour ensures you get the creamy caramel into your mouth as the booze chases it down. (Photographed next to a dry gin martini.) <b>The Grinch</b> Where: Kelley&#x27;s Restaurant & Bar, 5076 Velasko Road, Syracuse Ingredients: 2 ounces Ketel One vodka, a shot of Midori melon  liqueur, 1 strawberry.

It&#x27;s sweet, but you get a good feel for the quality bourbon. <i>Charlie Miller | cmiller@syracuse.com</i> <b>Pecan Manhattan</b> The staff at Al&#x27;s is made up of pros. During the shift change -- that time of the night when the older patrons filter out as the younger crowd shuffles in -- Al&#x27;s gets busy.

As the frozen pomegranate ball begins to thaw, it mixes with the booze. The drink&#x27;s taste changes. The Japanese gin is a nice change from my old standby, Bombay Sapphire. <i>Charlie Miller | cmiller@syracuse.com</i> <b>Sazerac</b> Where: Bistro Elephant, 238 W Jefferson St., Syracuse&#x27;s Armory Square Ingredients: Rye whiskey, simple syrup, Angostura bitters, Peychaud&#x27;s bitters Price: $12 This is the perfect drink for the bluesy setting at the Bistro Elephant. A jazz duet was playing Vince Guaraldi tunes from &quot;A Charlie Brown Christmas&quot; as I ordered this Louisiana-based drink. If you like a good whiskey cocktail, this is hard to beat. <i>Charlie Miller | cmiller@syracuse.com</i> <b>Under the Mistletoe</b> Where: Bistro Elephant, 238 W Jefferson St., Syracuse&#x27;s Armory Square Ingredients: Gin, muddled rosemary, thyme, fresh citrus, prosecco, cranberry Price: $13 <i>Charlie Miller | cmiller@syracuse.com</i> <b>Under the Mistletoe</b> Sure, this drink made Bistro Elephant&#x27;s holiday cocktail menu, but you could serve this all year round.

      "full": "By Jared Paventi and Jane Marmaduke Woodman Syracuse, N.Y. -- Our reviewers visit 52 restaurants a year -- so selecting the best things they ate along the way is a deliciously challenging task. This year, the list includes some surprising won tons, a bar favorite and lots of pork. Enjoy the samplings, and make sure to look for our best dessert list for 2018. <i>Jane Marmaduke Woodman </i> <b>Duck wontons</b> The Bistro at Villa Verona Vineyard 4914 State Road 365, Verona Reviewer: Jane Marmaduke Woodman One advantage of dining in a restaurant attached to a vineyard is the availability of flights of wine, the varied small servings allowing a taste of several varieties without overindulgence. At Villa Verona&#x27;s bistro, small plates are available to enjoy with flights of wine. One of the best choices offered on our visit was the duck wontons. <i>Jane Marmaduke Woodman </i> These wontons were stuffed with corn and duck bacon and served with wilted spinach and ponzu sauce, a classic thin Japanese sauce based on soy sauce and citrus. The filling was lush with melted cheese and tiny cubes of duck bacon, the exterior  delightfully crispy-chewy without oiliness. This starter was enough for two to share and made a delightful accompaniment to the small tastes of wine. <i>Jane Marmaduke Woodman</i> <b>Jerk Chicken</b> Bongo&#x27;s Jerk Hut 440 South Avenue, Syracuse Reviewer: Jane Marmaduke Woodman Bongo&#x27;s is a take-out place, though there are a few tables inside where customers can wait for their food. And it is well worth waiting for. The jerk chicken dinner from Bongo&#x27;s is plenty for two people, though we usually order extra cabbage and plantains simply because they are so good. The chicken is boneless thigh meat, cooked to melting tenderness in a medium-hot jerk sauce that flavors everything on the plate with the complexity of tomato, peppers, allspice, onions, garlic, vinegar and all the other seasonings that make jerk dishes so delicious. <i>Jane Marmaduke Woodman</i> The sides that come with dinners at Jerk Hut are as appealing as the center of the plate. Cabbage is cooked with shavings of carrot, blending the sweetness of the vegetables to contrast with the spicy chicken. Rice and peas (red beans) cooked in coconut milk provide a foundation for the other elements, allowing the diner to soak up any extra sauce. Other dishes from Bingo&#x27;s are certainly good, but the jerk chicken is one of the best things we eat in any year. <i>Jared Paventi   </i> <b>Veal osso bucco</b> The Chef & The Cook 7 Syracuse St., Baldwinsville Reviewer: Jared Paventi We chose &quot;In the Weeds&quot; during our meal at The Chef & The Cook. It&#x27;s an order that provides your table with one of everything from the menu. The veal osso bucco stood out above the rest. <i>Jared Paventi</i> Served in its tomato-based cooking liquid, the veal shank was torched tableside to add char. The thick tomato sauce created an umami-packed dish that quieted our table as we fought for pieces of veal and spoonfuls of sauce. <i>Jane Marmaduke Woodman   </i> <b>Spicy Fried Tofu</b> Dang&#x27;s Vietnamese Cafe 1828 Butternut Street, Syracuse Reviewer: Jane Marmaduke Woodman In a bright, new dining room on Butternut Street, we found one of the best dishes we enjoyed in 2018. In fact, Dang&#x27;s Kick-Butt Stir-fry, made with our choice of tofu, turned out to be the best fried tofu we&#x27;ve ever had. The plate was visually appealing, with prettily arranged tofu combined with onions, peppers and carrots and alongside a dome of white rice. <i>Jane Marmaduke Woodman</i> However, the flavors outshone even the appearance of the dish. The tofu was perfectly fried to a thin outer crispness and coated in sweet chili sauce. The jalapeños were sliced thin enough so they could be eaten with the tofu without being overpowering. Carrot medallions were fully cooked. This was a dish that will bring us back. <i>Jane Marmaduke Woodman</i> <b>Beef Sol Dot</b> Gangnam Style Korean Kitchen 115 Harvard Place, Syracuse Reviewer: Jane Marmaduke Woodman The great flavors of flash-cooked fresh ingredients stand on their own in expert combinations in Korean cuisine, so the diner can add degrees of heat and other flavors if she prefers. In our beef sol dot, a fried egg decorated with seaweed strips topped a mound of beef strips, zucchini, daikon, carrots, mushrooms and sprouts, all on a bed of rice that sizzled and popped for several minutes in the hot stone bowl on the table. <i>Jane Marmaduke Woodman</i> Each ingredient was mild, but the combination was artful and pretty, and as soon as the egg yolk was broken, it blended with the meat, vegetables, and the red pepper sauce made from gochujang (Korean red chili paste), 7-up, ginger, garlic and other ingredients to form a rich sauce that transformed the dish into an aromatic blend that made us eat every bite. The bottom layer of rice was perfectly crispy-chewy. It was wonderful. <i>Jared Paventi</i> <b>Classique Poutine</b> The Hops Spot 116 Walton St., Syracuse Reviewer: Jared Paventi Laugh if you want but The Hops Spot&#x27;s Classique Poutine is addictive and the closest you can find to the classic French-Canadian delicacy of fries, gravy and cheese curd. The Armory Square restaurant&#x27;s hand-cut fries had just enough savory beef gravy to coat without getting soggy. <i>Jared Paventi</i> What&#x27;s more is that the vegetarian poutine, made with a vegetable-based gravy, is just as good. <i>Jane Marmaduke Woodman</i> <b>Reef riggies</b>",

I’ve grown as an artist, too. I’ve really found my voice - no pun intended. But I really, really did feel like I found a good place for me musically. <b>How would you describe your sound to someone who has not heard your music before?</b> I would say that it is - uhm - it leans country because I am from the South and I’ve got a twang in my voice - I can’t get rid of it (laughs).

Hopefully at the end of the day people just call it good (laughs). <b>The 2014 single, “My Baby’s Got A Smile On Her Face,” debuted at No. 1. Why do you think so many people connected to that song?</b> I think there’s a lot of reasons for it. But I think the main one is that it was a fun song and of course I was just coming off of Team Blake. I can’t really pin it on that, either, because it’s not really happened since or before then. Maybe people connected to my story and they wanted to see me succeed so they went and bought it. <b>When you released your album, “Top Shelf,” what did you hope listeners could take away from the album?</b> For me, it was my best music to that point, hence the reason I called it “Top Shelf.” There are some special moments in there. I felt like there was a little bit more of a sophistication in that album versus albums previous - even before The Voice because there was a little bit more of a raw, rougher around the edges feel to those albums. This album felt a little bit more polished. <b>What’s next for you? What does the year ahead look like?</b> I’m looking forward to getting back into the studio. I’ve been writing a lot recently and I am definitely finding myself going back to that rough and rugged edge that I used to have in my music. I’m finding that to be appealing again.

      "full": "Cicero, N.Y. – The Carrinos and McAndrews have lived across the street from each other for decades. They have summer camps next to each other and watched their kids grow up together. And for years, the couples – a dental assistant, a barber, an insurance adjuster and a tire guy – have been talking about opening a restaurant. Finally the four of them went to a lender with a plan. “The bank laughed,” said Kathi McAndrews (the former insurance adjuster) at their unique partnership. But the friends kept at it, and after a year they convinced the bank, remodeled a former Mighty Taco and opened Vicinos Brick & Brew at 7789 Brewerton Road in Cicero in mid-November. Vicinos means neighbors in the Italian language. Betty Carrino is the dental assistant. Her husband Dan Carrino owns Nick’s Barbershop. And in addition to being a tire expert, Mark McAndrews (Kathi’s husband) is also a good cook. The restaurant is using many of his family recipes, and the two couples have spent many meals together cooking and perfecting the Vicinos menu. “We all have input on the menu,” Mark McAndrews said. The results are nine, 12-inch pizzas, $12 to $15, cooked to order in a 680-degree oven. There’s a meatball pizza and a Philly-cheese steak version. There’s also a pizza topped with vodka sauce. The Vicinos Pizza is one they came up with together. It’s chili-infused honey, smoked Gouda cheese and thick slices of pepperoni. The menu also includes burgers with fries, fire-roasted shrimp and peppers, and IPA-battered onion rings. Sandwiches comes with housemade chips. All have descriptions on the menu: The spicy Italian ($11.95) includes hot capicola, Genoa salami, ham and housemade giardiniera; the meatball Sammy ($9.95) includes Grandma D’s homemade meatballs with sauce and mozzarella. Then there’s the Used Meat sandwich ($9.95) with no description at all. The owners want customers to ask for details. Mark McAndrews came up with the idea after making so much sauce. He takes the pork and sausage that’s been simmering for hours in tomatoes and builds the sandwich with that. It goes on a hoagie, topped with provolone, mozzarella and sauce.",

      "full": "The Palace Theatre in Syracuse will once again host Greg Spencer’s annual Great Salt City Blues Concert on Wednesday, Dec. 26 at 7:30 p.m. Twenty-one of Syracuse’s finest musicians pay tribute to five legendary blues artists: Bobby “Blue” Bland, Jimmy Reed, Otis Rush, T-Bone Walker and Johnny Winter. Warren Linhart caught up with Spencer to chat about the upcoming show and the work that goes on behind the scenes. <b>Linhart:</b> This will be the third in a series of annual Great Salt City Blues Concerts that you have planned -- all stemming from your love of blues music and the record label you started in 1985 -- Blue Wave Records. <b>Spencer:</b> It started back then with concert promotion and then I got into recording local bands, The Kingsnakes being the first. I recognized there were local musicians that I thought were as good as some of the bands that were coming into town playing, and I wanted to record them. Now 33 years later, I’ve been concentrating more on the concert part of it. <b>W.L.:</b> You promoted a successful 30th Anniversary Kingsnakes show a few years back. Was that the impetus for this series you’ve started? <b>G.S.:</b> The Salt City Blues record I did in 1988 was in my mind as well as the 30th Anniversary celebration concert with The Kingsnakes at the Palace Theater, which went extremely well. I was very pleased with the reaction from people and sensed that there was a market in Syracuse that wasn’t being reached, namely people that remember the blues scene in its heyday here that don’t want to go to bars anymore but would rather sit down and watch a well-organized concert in a nice venue. The first Great Salt City Blues Concert was the result. This one will be the third in what I see as a continuing series of 10 concerts. <b>W.L.:</b> Will every concert in this series have a theme? <b>G.S.:</b> Yes, the reason I have a theme is because it gives the show a focus. Without focus, I believe the show would not be as entertaining to the audience. The focus affects my decisions of the people that I want on the show I’m planning now and for future shows. I try to pick the people who will be the right fit to honor those musicians who I&#x27;d like to honor. <b>W.L.: </b>And the musicians you hand-selected for this show are all from here? <b>G.S.: </b>Yes, I wanted to honor the musicians that have stayed and lived here in Syracuse. The first concert basically was for them. The restriction then was that in order to participate, they had to have lived, played and stayed around this area. I wasn&#x27;t going to bring anybody in from out of town or people that moved away. I also wanted to honor a couple people who are no longer with us, specifically at the time was Roosevelt Dean, Kelly James (Dr. Blue) and Kyle Shirley. Unfortunately, Dave Olson was to participate but with his untimely death, he was honored instead. <b>W.L.: </b>The Palace Theater is a nice cozy venue. How supportive have the owners of the Palace Theater been? <b>G.S.: </b>They are very responsive to being a venue for local people to do local things. They are not opposed to doing national things, of course, but they are keen on local. <b>W.L.: </b>Last year’s concert theme was the legacy of (Chicago-based) Chess Records, the greatest blues record label of them all. The theme you’ve come up with this year features the legacy of five musicians who have left an indelible mark on the blues. T-Bone certainly made his impact felt, the father of the electric blues guitar- an originator for sure. <b>G.S.: </b>Yes, if it were not for T-Bone Walker, there wouldn’t have been a B.B. King. Certainly, anybody who plays electric blues guitar knows T-Bone. <b>W.L.: </b>Otis Rush passed just recently. He certainly was a major player as were all the others. Jimmy Reed was cited as a major influence with many of the British Invasion bands who loved the American blues.",

      "full": "By Jacob Pucci | jpucci@syracuse.com For some, eggnog is a gently-spiced creamy treat that evokes festive yuletide feelings with each sip. For others grossed out by the idea of drinking eggs, it&#x27;s a sickly-sweet stomach ache in a bottle. Regardless of where you stand on that issue, it&#x27;s safe to say that drinking 17 different eggnogs in one sitting is not a good idea. But that&#x27;s what we did, because we wanted to find the best eggnog you can find in your local Upstate New York grocery store. <i>Jacob Pucci | jpucci@syracuse.com</i> <b>The contenders</b> Judging: Our judging panel included six members of the syracuse.com | The Post-Standard and NYup.com team: Best of CNY and Upstate New York writer and critic Jacob Pucci; managing producer Charlie Miller; beer, wine and spirits writer Don  Cazentre, video journalist Katrina Tulloch; food and restaurant reporter Teri Weaver and features director Steve Carlic. Criteria: Each nog was judged on a blind taste test and critiqued on appearance, aroma, taste and overall opinion. After the initial round of tastings, the judges voted on the six finalists. A second round of tastings among the six finalists determined the winner. The competing eggnogs, available in stores around Central New York, are a mix of nationally-available name brands, regionally-available store brands and locally-produced products. All prices listed are retail prices before any loyalty card discounts. <i>Jacob Pucci | jpucci@syracuse.com</i> <b>No. 17: Silk Nog</b> Appearance: Pale, tan, only a slight bit yellow. Aroma: Strangely sour. Almost lemony. Taste: Same vaguely sour flavor that we picked up on the aroma. Fake, abrasive nutmeg flavor. Almost as thin as skim milk. Price: $2.99 per quart. Overall: We wanted to see what dairy-free and lactose-free options were out there, but truth be told, not drinking any eggnog is better than drinking this gluey, almost translucent eggnog. <i>Jacob Pucci | jpucci@syracuse.com</i> <b>No. 16: Horizon Organic</b> Appearance: Pale white. Aroma: Candy-like. Some judges compared it to circus peanuts. Taste: Sweet and powdery, like Necco wafers. Price: $3.99 per quart. Overall: Based off the quality of the raw ingredients, we had high hopes for this organic eggnog, but this drink was strangely pale, lacked spice and left us with an unpleasant chalky aftertaste. &quot;It&#x27;s like licking a chalkboard,&quot; judge Teri Weaver said. <i>Jacob Pucci | jpucci@syracuse.com</i> <b>No. 15: Lactaid Eggnog</b> Appearance: Deep yellow. Almost orange. Aroma: Strong notes of sweetened condensed milk. Taste: Sickly sweet, with a strong, fake vanilla flavor. Like the Horizon Organic nog, this drink was also a bit chalky. Price: $3.19 per quart. Overall: The poor showing from the alternative nogs continues. This drink was just way too sweet, with a flavor judge Katrina Tulloch deemed &quot;upsetting&quot; and &quot;really not festive.&quot; <i>Jacob Pucci | jpucci@syracuse.com</i> <b>No. 14: International Delight</b> Appearance: Pale, almost white. Aroma: Vanilla, and little else. Taste: The strong aroma of vanilla carried over to the flavor, but it was too artificial and left a strange aftertaste. This nog was also way too thin. Price: $3.79 per quart. Overall: This was the only beverage we tried that billed itself as a &quot;festive dairy nog.&quot; While we&#x27;re all about festivities, we weren&#x27;t about this egg-free nog that includes water and a whole host of thickeners as ingredients. <i>Jacob Pucci | jpucci@syracuse.com</i> <b>No. 13: Byrne Dairy Santa&#x27;s Pack Recipe</b> Appearance: Light yellow, creamy. Aroma: A little eggy. Some orange? Taste: That unexpected orange come through even stronger here. Distinct citrus flavor with a bit of artificial vanilla. This nog was a bit too thin as well. Price: $5.68 per half-gallon. Overall: We were let down by this local favorite. &quot;Like a creamsicle, and sadly, not in a good way,&quot; judge Teri Weaver said. All the rest of the judges agreed. <i>Jacob Pucci | jpucci@syracuse.com</i> <b>No. 12: Almond Breeze</b> Appearance: Pale tan and translucent. Aroma: Weak notes of almonds. Taste: Despite doing a blind taste test, we all knew this was almond-based. It wasn&#x27;t any thicker than regular almond milk and had almost no spice flavor. Price: $3.49 per quart. Overall: This was the best of the alternative eggnogs we tried simply because it was the least offensive. It was just like regular almond milk with the faintest note of cinnamon and nutmeg. <i>Jacob Pucci | jpucci@syracuse.com</i> <b>No. 11: Pics (Price Chopper)</b> Appearance: Your standard lightly yellow, creamy nog. Aroma: A little bit of spice, but the aroma was weak. Taste: Strong artificial spice flavor. Not as sweet as you&#x27;d expect. Price: $4.49 per half-gallon. Overall: The texture was on point, but the fake spice flavor gave this eggnog an unpleasant aftertaste. &quot;No, no, no,&quot; judge Teri Weaver said. <i>Jacob Pucci | jpucci@syracuse.com</i> <b>No. 10: Southern Comfort</b> Appearance: Bold orange/yellow color. Aroma: A bit of orange on the nose, but it was more pleasant here than it was in the Santa&#x27;s Pack eggnog. A bit of booze, but that could just be the brand name talking. Taste: Easily the thickest of the 17 eggnogs. The orange flavor came through in this custardy nog. Price: $2.50 per quart. Overall: It&#x27;s made by Hood, which if you read further, you&#x27;ll find out they have a habit of making sweet, ice cream-like eggnogs. Judges Don Cazentre and Teri Weaver, both native Southerners, liked how thick this eggnog was, while the judges born north of the Mason-Dixon line thought it was too thick. <i>Jacob Pucci | jpucci@syracuse.com</i> <b>No. 9: Trader Joe&#x27;s</b> Appearance: Very milky and paler than others. Aroma: A bit boozy. Taste: This eggnog was among the least sweet that we tried. It was mild, with a bite of spice. Price: $2.99 per quart. Overall: Due in part to the lack of sweetness, this eggnog was fairly bland. The alcohol flavor on the nose translated into a flavor judge Charlie Miller compared to Butter Rum Lifesavers candies. <i>Jacob Pucci | jpucci@syracuse.com</i> <b>No. 8: Purity </b> Appearance: More white than yellow. Closer to heavy cream. Aroma: Tons of vanilla. The ingredients list pure vanilla and it came through strong. Taste: As one would expect, vanilla was the primary flavor. It&#x27;s not too sweet and even had a bit of salt. Price: $9.99 a half-gallon. Overall: The judges were split on this one. This eggnog had the fewest ingredients: Milk, cream, sugar, eggs, dry buttermilk, gelatin (the only thickener), salt and vanilla. Which means notably missing was any kind of spice, be it nutmeg or cinnamon. If you don&#x27;t like spice, or you want to add your own, this is a great eggnog. <i>Jacob Pucci | jpucci@syracuse.com</i> <b>No. 7: Upstate Farms Premium</b>",

The Bethel Woods Center for the Arts confirmed Thursday that it will host a three-day event on August 16-18, 2019, titled “Bethel Woods Music and Culture Festival.” The “pan-generational music, culture, and community event” will celebrate the golden anniversary of the original Woodstock concert with a series of concerts, “TED-style talks,” and a “We Are Golden” history exhibit at the Museum at Bethel Woods. &quot;Fifty years ago, people gathered peacefully on our site inspired to change the world through music. As the stewards of this historic site, we remain committed to preserving this rich history and spirit and to educating and inspiring new generations to contribute positively to the world through music, culture and community,” Bethel Woods CEO Darlene Fedun said in a statement.

      "full": "By Jacob Pucci | jpucci@syracuse.com We&#x27;re hitting the road to find Central New York&#x27;s best Italian restaurant.  We tallied all the nominations and named our five finalists. On Wednesday, we made our fourth stop of the search. The judges are Jacob Pucci and Charlie Miller from syracuse.com and Mary Kiernan, an American Culinary Federation-certified chef de cuisine who teaches at Syracuse University. As we visit each finalist, the public can vote on which restaurant the readers&#x27; choice award. In the meantime, here&#x27;s a look at our trip so far with a few details of our meals. Our full reviews will come when we announce the winners on  Wednesday, Dec. 19. <i>Charlie Miller | cmiller@syracuse.com</i> <b>No. 4: a mano kitchen & bar</b> Angotti&#x27;s opened in 1961. Joey&#x27;s and Santangelo&#x27;s opened in 1982 and 1986, respectively. Then there&#x27;s a mano. This spot inside the Icon Tower in downtown Syracuse opened in September. Can this restaurant do in three months what took other restaurants three decades? Address: 344 S. Warren St., Syracuse <i>Charlie Miller | cmiller@syracuse.com</i> <b>a mano</b> A mano blends elements of old-school red sauce joints with contemporary flavors, all with a more refined approach that makes the restaurant stand out. Take the meatball. A staple of Italian dining, the meatballs at a mano ($8 for five good-sized meatballs) are made in-house, topped with smoked mozzarella cheese and plum tomato sauce and broiled until the cheese is browned. Tender, but not too soft on the inside, with a thin, crisp crust on the outside, these meatballs had an ideal balance of texture, along with a meaty flavor more assertive than others we&#x27;ve had so far. <i>Charlie Miller | cmiller@syracuse.com</i> <b>a mano</b> A similar approach was taken to the chicken Parmesan. At a mano, it&#x27;s called &quot;skillet parm&quot; and it&#x27;s served as an appetizer ($9). Add a side of pasta and it&#x27;s easily as big as a chicken parm platter that would be double the price at another Italian restaurant. As for the chicken itself, it was juicy and tender enough to cut with a fork. There was plenty of sauce, but thanks to what appeared to be a quick broil, rather than a long bake, the breaded chicken was still crispy. <i>Charlie Miller | cmiller@syracuse.com</i> <b>a mano</b> All the pasta at a mano is homemade, including the thin linguine that went into this dish of Spaghetti & Clams ($11 small, $19 large). Fresh pasta, more so than dried pasta, has a habit of turning unpalatably gummy and stuck together when overcooked. But this pasta was cooked superbly, with just a bit of toothsome bite. The half-dozen whole clams were sourced from Prince Edward Island and we all agreed they were exceptionally juicy. The sauce, loaded with fresh garlic and herbs, was thicker than what you usually find, which meant it coated the pasta exceptionally well. It was so think, we thought the sauce was bound together with egg yolks. We were wrong: It was only butter and a bit of the starchy pasta water. &quot;This tastes like something you&#x27;d have in Nantucket,&quot; judge Charlie Miller said. <i>Charlie Miller | cmiller@syracuse.com</i> <b>a mano</b> It may be winter outside, but this dish was a bite of fall. These cappelletti ($10 small, $18 large) are filled with pumpkin, served in browned butter and fried sage and topped with spiced pumpkin seeds, grated Parmesan cheese and a fonduta--the Italian version of the Swiss favorite--made with taleggio cheese. Browned butter and sage is an all-time favorite of mine and this rendition did not disappoint. Like the aforementioned thin linguine, the texture of this pasta had a certain amount of resilience characteristic of well-made fresh pasta that complemented the smooth, soft pumpkin nicely. It was toasty, nutty, warm and indulgent. <i>Charlie Miller | cmiller@syracuse.com</i> <b>a mano</b> Never ones to shy away from a challenge, we ordered the whole branzino ($27), one of four non-pastas or pizza entrees on the menu. Judge Mary Kiernan skillfully broke down the fish, which had been roasted in the restaurant&#x27;s open wood-fired oven. We remarked how tender the fish was as it easily jumped out of its skins and bones and onto our plates. Of the three accompanying sauces, we loved the romesco, a Catalonian sauce of roasted red peppers and nuts, the most. <i>Charlie Miller | cmiller@syracuse.com</i> <b>a mano</b> It&#x27;s also worth mentioning that a mano starts your meal with house-made focaccia and herb and cheese cracker that our waitress described as a &quot;homemade Cheez-It.&quot; They also offer a few slices of DiLauro&#x27;s Italian bread with a compound butter. <i>Jacob Pucci | jpucci@syracuse.com</i> <b>a mano</b> Click here to see more from a mano kitchen & bar Pictured: Spinach rotolo ($10 small, $18 large), served with tomato bechamel sauce, chili oil and grated Parmesan cheese. <b>Don&#x27;t forget to vote!</b> Let your voice be heard. Who among our five finalists is the best Italian restaurant in Central New York? You can vote once a day in the poll above. Voting ends Dec. 18. <i>Charlie Miller | cmiller@syracuse.com</i> <b>No. 3: Francesca&#x27;s Cucina</b> Francesca&#x27;s opened on North Salina Street in Syracuse&#x27;s Little Italy neighborhood in 2004, but the history of this family-owned restaurant dates back much further. Owner George Angeloro&#x27;s grandparents, Angelo and Francesca, owned Angeloro&#x27;s Cafe on State Street in the city from 1910 to 1989. To this day, many of the recipes, from the marinara sauce to the homemade gnocchi, are Francesca Angeloro creations. Address: 545 N. Salina St., Syracuse. <br/><br/> <i>Jacob Pucci | jpucci@syracuse.com</i> <b>Francesca&#x27;s</b> Salad greens are healthy and great and all, but when it comes to a great antipasto salad, it&#x27;s all about what&#x27;s on top. At Francesca&#x27;s, it&#x27;s cured pork and lots of it. Paper-thin slices of tender prosciutto and rolled and sliced capicola and salami were the foundation for the formidable meat mountain, which was complemented by provolone cheese, artichoke hearts, roasted red peppers, red onion, hot cherry peppers, olives and hard-boiled egg that was just the teeniest bit soft in the middle. Just in case there wasn&#x27;t enough protein, heaping chunks of tuna served as the cherry on top. The small version, pictured above, is $9.99, while the large is $12.99. <i>Jacob Pucci | jpucci@syracuse.com</i> <b>Francesca&#x27;s </b> Francesca&#x27;s offers the most expansive menu we&#x27;ve seen so far, and that doesn&#x27;t include the five entree and two appetizer specials of the evening that our waitress effortlessly recited. Of the specials, the steak--dry-aged in house for 30 days--and lobster tail, served with fingerling potatoes roasted in duck fat, sounded transcendentally delicious, but that will have to be saved for another visit. For our entrees, we ordered chicken Parmesan ($17.99), linguini with white clam sauce ($17.99), pork braciole ($21.99) and since Francesca&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t offer a traditional red sauce lasagna or baked pasta dish, a vegetable lasagna ($17.99). A side of meatballs ($3.99 for two) rounded out the meal. <i>Jacob Pucci | jpucci@syracuse.com</i> <b>Francesca&#x27;s</b> At Santangelo&#x27;s, the sauce was smooth, with a touch of sweetness. The sauce at Angotti&#x27;s was equally smooth, but darker, more savory and almost meaty, as if it had been simmering on the stove all day. On the other hand, the sauce at Francesca&#x27;s is chunky and clearly made from whole tomatoes, with a similarly subtle sweetness that helps neutralize some of the acidity from the tomatoes. The sauce was on full display in the chicken Parmesan, pictured above. <i>Jacob Pucci | jpucci@syracuse.com</i> <b>Francesca&#x27;s </b> Linguini with white clam sauce sounds simple in theory. Recipes vary, but saute some onion and garlic in olive oil, add the clams and a splash of white wine and simmer until the clams are done. Add some butter and fresh parsley, toss it with cooked pasta and you&#x27;re well on your way to a great dinner. But the dish can sometimes be a slick of bland, oily pasta, or a mess of overcooked, rubbery clams that no amount of sauce can salvage. Francesca&#x27;s nailed it. The sauce is loaded with fresh herbs and the clams, a mix of chopped and whole in-shell, were tender. Lemon added a brightness to the sauce that was thicker than others we&#x27;ve had in the past--Perhaps a bit of the starchy pasta water in the sauce?--which meant that it actually stuck to the noodles and didn&#x27;t form a useless puddle in the bowl. <i>Jacob Pucci | jpucci@syracuse.com</i> <b>Francesca&#x27;s</b> Click here to see more from Francesca&#x27;s Cucina <i>Charlie Miller | cmiller@syracuse.com</i> <b>No. 2: Angotti&#x27;s Family Restaurant</b> Every cliche you&#x27;ll hear about Sunday supper at an Italian grandmother&#x27;s house rings true at Angotti&#x27;s. Not only is the restaurant located inside a house, where the conversations on the phone go between English and Italian, but the red-sauce heavy food is pure Italian-American that warm both body and soul. Address: 725 Burnet Ave., Syracuse. <i>Jacob Pucci | jpucci@syracuse.com</i> <b>Angotti&#x27;s</b> There&#x27;s a colorful trend in most of the food in Angotti&#x27;s, in case you couldn&#x27;t tell by the picture above. The red sauce is a family recipe owners Bobby Angotti and his parents Anthony and Susie developed when they took over the restaurant in 1986 from Carmine Angotti, Bobby&#x27;s grandfather, who opened the restaurant in 1961, five years after he moved from Taverna, Italy to Syracuse. Related:  Keeping it classic: 4 Syracuse Italian restaurants that have stood the test of time The sauce coats the bottoms of platters of chicken Parmesan, lasagna and eggplant Parmesan like a silky-smooth bedsheet. It tops the side bowls of al dente spaghetti. When our waitress asked if we&#x27;d like a side of sauce for our hilariously-large cheese and sausage calzone, we said yes, not knowing that it was akin to bringing a kiddie pool to the ocean. Clockwise from bottom left: Eggplant Parmesan ($14.95), linguine with white clam sauce ($11.95), lasagna ($8.95), chicken Parmesan ($14.95), cup of extra sauce, side of spaghetti and a sausage and cheese calzone ($7.25). <i>Charlie Miller | cmiller@syracuse.com</i> <b>Angotti&#x27;s</b> The antipasto salad at Angotti&#x27;s comes in three sizes and range in price from $5.75 to $9.95. The medium pictured above ($7.95) was billed as serving two, but it was plenty for the three of us. The bed of iceburg lettuce was topped with sliced ham, salami, provolone cheese, black olives, grape tomatoes and cucumbers. The tuna is optional, but recommended. The bread at Angotti&#x27;s is from Geddes Bakery in North Syracuse, which, having opened in 1957, has been around CNY even longer than Angotti&#x27;s. <i>Charlie Miller | cmiller@syracuse.com</i> <b>Angotti&#x27;s</b> We devoured the platters of chicken, eggplant and lasagna, sopping up what sauce was left over with bread (or a spoon. I don&#x27;t think anyone saw me...) Because we were obviously trying to keep our meal light, we also got an order of linguini with whole baby clams in a garlic and oil sauce. <i>Jacob Pucci | jpucci@syracuse.com</i> <b>Angotti&#x27;s</b> With not one, but two steak knifes poking out the top like an old rabbit ear TV, this calzone is loaded with about as much dairy as a milk cow and is nearly as big. The calzone is filled with ricotta, mozzarella and Romano cheeses. Extra fillings--we added Italian sausage--are 75 cents each. The pizza dough used was excellent--pleasantly salty, with just the right amount of chew. It was structurally-sound and despite all the ricotta cheese inside, the bottom never got soggy or limp. <i>Jacob Pucci | jpucci@syracuse.com</i> <b>Angotti&#x27;s</b> Click here to see more from Angotti&#x27;s Family Restaurant <i>Charlie Miller | cmiller@syracuse.com</i> <b>No. 1: Santangelo&#x27;s </b> Santangelo&#x27;s has been around since 1986--a lifetime in the restaurant industry--yet when it comes to our five finalists, Santangelo&#x27;s falls squarely in the middle. That&#x27;s evidence not only of restaurants with great food and service, but of Italian cuisine&#x27;s staying power in Central New York. Address: 673 Old Liverpool Road, Liverpool. <i>Charlie Miller | cmiller@syracuse.com</i> <b>Santangelo&#x27;s</b> Dinner started with a shared &#x27;small&#x27; antipasto salad ($12.99 small, $16.99 large). The salad was amply topped with soppressata, salami, roasted red peppers, tuna, pepperoncini, olives, artichoke hearts, Asiago cheese and egg, with a light vinaigrette dressing. Despite the weight of the toppings, the mixed greens underneath stood strong and didn&#x27;t lose their crunch. <i>Charlie Miller | cmiller@syracuse.com</i> <b>Santangelo&#x27;s</b> Pictured here is our full spread. Clockwise from left: Chicken Parmesan with a side of penne ($17.99), meatballs ($3.99), bread with balsamic vinegar and seasoned olive oil for dipping, Stuffed Veal Raymo ($23.99) with a side of Utica greens ($6.99), lasagna ($17.99) and linguini with white clam sauce ($19.99.).",

      "full": "It&#x27;s impossible to walk around a show like the annual Syracuse Nationals and not pick out cars that you covet, or cars like those you, your father or grandfather owned in years past. I do it all of the time, and I know many others do, too. The question is, do people flock to the show for the spectacle, or to allow themselves to be taken back in time by thousands of dream machines? I suspect for many visitors it&#x27;s a little of both, dreaming of cars from the past, but reveling in the thousands of sights and sounds, too. Since we&#x27;re at the halfway point between the 2018 show and the upcoming 20th anniversary 2019 Syracuse Nationals, it&#x27;s a good time to share a few cars that drew my interest during the 2018 show. In all cases, and dozens more, I was attracted to these cars for their workmanship and beauty, as well as their sentimental value. And in the interest of full disclosure, one of the cars, a 1958 Pontiac Chieftan two-door hardtop, was previously featured on Syracuse.com, and in The Post-Standard, but I&#x27;m including it because when I was a kid my father had an identical Chieftan. <i>Kenn Peters</i> <b>1951 Fleetline Chevy</b> Albert Mastrota, of Wilmington, Del., brought this 1951 Fleetline Chevy lead sled to the show, finished in flat paint, old school style. The car is elegant in its own way, and Albert said it&#x27;s a pleasure to drive. He&#x27;s owned it for 15 years. <i>Kenn Peters</i> <b>1968 Pontiac LeMans</b> This beautiful 1968 Pontiac LeMans s owned by Bill Kline, of Whitesboro, N.Y. This car was a project, to say the least, because it underwent a frame-off restoration that took eight years from beginning to end. And Bill has owned the car for only 10 years. Such classic touches on this car, especially the white interior, which is something you don&#x27;t see anymore. <i>Kenn Peters</i> <b>1956 Chevy Nomad</b> A 1956 Chevy Nomad is always nice to see, but this particular one, built by father-daughter team, Jerika and Chris Hepler, of Oil City, PA., is particularly stunning. The restoration took them eight years, but they did it right and saw to every detail, including installation of a fuel-injected 327 cubic inch V-8 engine. <i>Kenn Peters</i> <b>1970 Buick Electra 225</b> Anthony Jones, of Syracuse, owns this 1970 Buick Electra 225, commonly referred to in the day as a deuce-and-a-quarter. Anthony has owned this car for five years and has kept it in beautiful shape. What makes this car interesting is the fact that 1970 was the final year for an Electra convertible. While the &#x27;70 ragtop was the last one, it had the first 455 cubic inch, 370-horsepower V-8 engine. <i>Kenn Peters</i> <b>Rolls Weight</b> Here&#x27;s something you&#x27;ll never see again, a Rolls Weight rat rod. That&#x27;s what Mark Wright, of Clyde, N.Y., calls this home built car, which sports an authentic looking Rolls grille, but is actually a grille he built. The engine is a V-8 from a bus, and the gas tank holds 42 gallons. This car is large, but well designed and built. <i>Kenn Peters</i> <b>1949 Chevy pickup</b> Ron Powers, and grandson, Lucas, 8, of Port Byron, N.Y., brought two cars to the show, a 1949 Chevy pickup, sporting a 350 cubic inch V-8 crate engine, and a 1962 Chevy Impala SS, with a 475-horsepower, 409 cubic inch engine. The pickup, as you can see, has custom touches from a shave grille to custom wheels. <i>Kenn Peters</i> <b>1962 Impala SS</b> This 1962 Impala SS, was also brought to the show by Ron Powers and Lucas, and it is brimming with custom work, much of it nestled under the hood. A few of the goodies include the period correct 409 475-horsepower engine, Edelbrock aluminum heads, Pertronic electronic distributor, a factory-correct dual quad intake. <i>Kenn Peters</i> <b>1967 Chevrolet Camaro RS/SS</b> If you were to see this 1967 all original Chevrolet Camaro RS/SS, in person, you&#x27;d probably ask when it was restored? Well, it was painted in 2010, the original Mountain green. This numbers matching car is owned by Leon and Caleb McCarthy, of Baldwinsville, N.Y. Although Caleb is still too young to drive, it&#x27;s certain that the car will still be in beautiful condition when he&#x27;s old enough. It has the 350 cubic inch, 295-horsepower engine, a Muncie M20 4-speed transmission, the Rally Sport package, This car began life in Long Beach, CA., and now 71,480 miles later it&#x27;s better than ever in Baldwinsville. <i>Kenn Peters</i> <b>1953 Ford Victoria</b> David Capitano, of Webster, N.Y., and his 1953 Ford Victoria, finished in authentic Flamingo Red with Sungate Ivory. This car is pretty much stock, although the 110 horsepower Flathead V-8 has had some minor work and now produces 140 horsepower. <i>Kenn Peters</i> <b>1970 Oldsmobile Vista Cruiser</b> This spectacular 1970 Oldsmobile Vista Cruiser represents nearly five years of work by owner Steve Bicker, who said he did everything on the car including the paint. <i>Kenn Peters</i> <b>1958 Pontiac Chieftan</b>",

The hills are alive at the Landmark Theatre, and the buzz along the 300 block of South Salina Street Tuesday night was that of a sated, happy audience leaving a dark theater with a light heart. The Famous Artists Broadway Theater Series production of &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; is gorgeous, uplifting, and unexpectedly fresh despite its familiarity, with two captivating leads who redefine Maria and Captain von Trapp just enough to reinvigorate their love story. With original direction by Jack O&#x27;Brien, this &quot;Sound of Music&quot; offers an intelligent approach to the story of a wealthy Austrian widower, a former naval officer, who hires a young postulant from a nearby abbey to live in his sprawling lakeside villa as governess to his seven mischievous children, all on the brink of World War II. Slight changes to the film version upend the show just enough for you to puzzle over why it feels different without realizing how. (Spoiler reveal at the very end if you&#x27;re planning on going and don&#x27;t want the surprise ruined.) Based on true events,  the real von Trapp story was a May-December romance; Georg (pronounced GAY-org) von Trapp was a good quarter century older than 22-year-old Maria. The casting in this production has less of the Christopher Plummer/Julie Andrews mismatch and a touch more chemistry in the style of Hulu&#x27;s &quot;The Handmaid&#x27;s Tale&quot;; Mike McLean looks like Joseph Fiennes playing Commander Waterford, exuding more stubble-cheeked sexiness from Georg than what we&#x27;re used to, while Jill-Christine Wiley&#x27;s Maria balances sweet girlishness with a blonde-hued steel-backboned resistance that echoes Elizabeth Moss&#x27;s June/Offred handmaid. Both McLean and Wiley have stunning range, pitch and power, their notes soaring over the dual levels of the Landmark like a musical boomerang delivering all the feels while bringing attention back to the performance onstage. The von Trapp children are less cute but more authentic as kids, with piping voices that carry complex harmonies during their big songs &quot;Do-Re-Mi,&quot;  &quot;My Favorite Things,&quot; &quot;The Lonely Goatherd,&quot; and &quot;So Long, Farewell.&quot; Though they slide a bit off-key when singing unaccompanied, this actually works in their favor by emphasizing their youth and lack of sophisticated polish. In the role of Liesl, the &quot;Sixteen Going on Seventeen&quot; oldest von Trapp child, Lauren O&#x27;Brien skillfully walks the tightrope between child and woman, still innocent yet aware of her effect on seventeen-year-old Rolf. As played by Hunter Brown, Rolf is a hormone-fueled near-Nazi in tight corduroy shorts, barely able to control his urges when he sings, &quot;I am seventeen going on eighteen / I&#x27;ll...&quot; and then trails off, unable to voice what he really feels. It&#x27;s a performance that hits the refresh button on what this musical is about: a country slipping from civility toward inhumanity, with Rolf looking very much like those young men carrying tiki torches through the streets of Charlottesville. Rolf&#x27;s reboot in this production reminds us that underneath the surface beauty, betrayal can bubble up from the depths. The biggest surprise and delight of this production is Lauren Kidwell, a musical theater powerhouse who I&#x27;m guessing can&#x27;t be much older than 30; she crushed the role of the Mother Abbess -- and truly, there&#x27;s no other way to describe it. In &quot;Climb Ev&#x27;ry Mountain&quot; and its reprise, she not only tops the summit but reduces it to magic dust, scattering it over the audience with every rich note of her astounding voice. The granddaughter of opera singers, it shows: Kidwell was the audience favorite opening night in Syracuse, judging from the applause after her performances and during final bows. The orchestra of unseen, uncredited musicians weaves a vibrant tapestry of sound which cradles the vocal performances -- another reason to see live theater instead of just rewatching the movie. Onstage, scenic designer Douglas W. Schmidt creates a sense of outsized scale and vivid color while keeping furniture and props to a minimum. A bright watercolor-inspired backdrop of mountain peaks, swirling clouds, lush green hills and silhouetted evergreens dominates the stage during the opening title song then recedes to the background as scenes in the von Trapp villa play out. This set, more than any other in recent memory, reflects the fragile nature of the world of &quot;The Sound of Music.&quot; The walls of the von Trapp villa are translucent, a complex pattern of white lace through which the muted colors of the mountain landscape can be seen; and while the structure seems solid, with floor-to-ceiling windows and a curved staircase which sweeps down from offstage, there&#x27;s the implication that this house, just like the world of the von Trapps, can and will unravel quickly once Germany starts tugging at the fabric of Austrian society. It&#x27;s a subtle touch that infuses the production with a sense of fragile, ephemeral wonder. Video gamers will know the concept of the Easter egg, a hidden inside joke waiting to be discovered. For avid local theatergoers, especially season ticket holders to Cortland Repertory Theater, that happens in the second half of the show when Admiral von Schreiber, a Nazi commander of the German navy, speaks his handful of lines. I know him! I thought and squinted at my program. Turns out he&#x27;s James Taylor Odom, nominated for a Best Actor SALT Award for the comedy &quot;Rough Crossing&quot; at Cortland Rep this past summer and previously seen as the lead in &quot;The 39 Steps&quot; in 2017. Plus, he was on the boards of the Landmark last year for the Famous Artists production &quot;A Gentleman&#x27;s Guide to Love and Murder.&quot; The fact that an actor of his talent has a walk-on role in this &quot;Sound of Music&quot; illustrates the caliber of this cast and the level of every performance.",

      "next_sentence_true": "The pub posted the event on Facebook: Grammer&#x27;s plans to launch Faith American Brewing became public in March 2016.",
      "full": "It&#x27;s here: Actor Kelsey Grammer&#x27;s long-awaited Faith American Ale is now on the market across Upstate New York. The beer, described as &quot;a Belgian style ale with the crisp refreshing taste of a lager,&quot; is available in cans and on tap in stores and bars from the Hudson Valley to the Adirondacks and Albany to Buffalo. It can be found on tap at bars like The Excelsior Pub in Albany, The Red Jug Pub in Oneonta, Pastabilities in Syracuse and the Gatehouse Cafe in Rochester. Retail outlets carrying cans include Glenville Beverage in Scotia, Marcy Discount Beverages in Marcy (north of Utica), and Green Hills Farm Store in Syracuse. While it&#x27;s unclear exactly where it&#x27;s being brewed, the company is based in Margaretville, in Delaware County. Grammer, best known as a star of the TV shows &quot;Cheers&quot; and &quot;Frasier,&quot; has been working for several years to establish the brewery on a Catskills Region farm he bought near Margaretville. The State Liquor Authority lists a wholesale beer license at Grammer&#x27;s property on Ruff Road in Margaretville, but not a brewery license. The wholesale license, in the name of Grammer&#x27;s wife, Kayte, allows the company to market and distribute the beer, but not produce it. On Saturday, Grammer stopped by the Jay St. Pub in Schenectady to promote the beer&#x27;s release. The pub posted the event on Facebook: Grammer&#x27;s plans to launch Faith American Brewing became public in March 2016. The project got another jolt of publicity in July 2017, when he talked about it on the morning TV show &quot;Live with Kelly and Ryan.&quot; At that time, Grammer said the brewery was delayed by concerns over pollution control issues. Earlier this year, Faith American briefly posted two videos about the project on Facebook (they&#x27;ve since been taken down). In them, Grammer talked about the beer and the proposed brewery, and hinted at the timetable. &quot;We&#x27;ve still got a few years to go before we&#x27;re actually brewing beer on this site,&quot; Grammer says in one of the videos, which were shot in the summer of 2017.  &quot;But we&#x27;ve started with the beer already and we&#x27;re very excited about it.&quot; Grammer talks in the videos about the plans he has to build the brewery on a former dairy farm he purchased more than 25 years ago. &quot;Twenty-five years ago I found this land and fell in love with it and ever since then I&#x27;ve been trying to figure out a way to return it to a kind glory,&quot; he said on one of the videos. &quot;This was once a vital area, it was once sawmill -- there was a sawmill on the creek. i just took it on myself to believe that it was my obligation to find a way to  make it prosperous again. ... Several years ago I bought the barn at the top of the hill and that seemed to be the perfect place for a brewery.&quot; In 2017, Grammer had a pilot batch of Faith American Ale brewed under contract at the former Shmaltz Brewing Co. brewhouse in Clifton Park, north of Albany. That brewery has since been bought by Singlecut Beersmiths of Queens. (Shmaltz is now having its beers made elsewhere under contract).

The short visit resurrects past demons and present temptations for Ben, testing his mother&#x27;s anxious balance of trust and suspicion. It&#x27;s the second standout performance this fall for Roberts, who also stars in Amazon&#x27;s acclaimed conspiracy thriller &quot;Homecoming&quot; as a government-sponsored caseworker coaxing soldiers back into civilian life. It&#x27;s a more dramatic chapter for Roberts, the most quintessential of movie stars, who at 51 is stretching in new directions that are increasingly further afield from the frothier romantic comedies she built her career on. &quot;With age comes more complexity of possible parts,&quot; Roberts said in a recent interview. &quot;You know, I&#x27;m happy and I have fun at home, so it would take a lot for someone to say: &#x27;Look, you can play this part where you&#x27;re happy and have fun.&#x27; Well, I just do that at home!&quot;",

How else to explain the robust popularity of &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; which celebrates its 175th anniversary this year? Or &quot;It&#x27;s a Wonderful Life,&quot; now 72 years old? These classic stories remain dear to us because they&#x27;re rooted in a time and a place that we look back on fondly. We turn to them as part of our annual ritual; it&#x27;s a holiday habit that has us suspending judgment as we sink into their familiar narratives. &quot;Miracle on 34th Street&quot; is another of those Christmas classics, a 1947 film that&#x27;s a perennial favorite on cable, one which continues to outshine its subsequent remakes (four and counting). The tale of a how a Macy&#x27;s store Santa goes on trial in an effort to prove he&#x27;s the real jolly old elf himself works because it&#x27;s a product of an era in which crowds flocked to department stores, face-to-face retail was king, and kindness could still save the day. The Central New York Playhouse&#x27;s production of &quot;Miracle on 34th Street&quot; sticks to that story...almost. In her program notes, director Bella Calabria writes, &quot;I&#x27;ve decided to set this &#x27;Miracle&#x27; in present day. The message is timeless.&quot; Maybe, but the script -- based on the film and adapted in 1982 by Mountain Community Theater in Santa Cruz County, CA  -- is ho-hum. In updating the story to a contemporary setting, the adaptation loses the protective sheen of nostalgia. Other weaknesses: the characters retain tone-deaf, outdated names like Fred Gailey; the dialogue is maudlin; and the pacing painfully slow even for 1982, a world that had seen the debut of MTV and its frenetic quick-edit style a year earlier. Simple and at times boring, the show is often licensed to middle schools/high schools for student productions. Fortunately the CNY Playhouse &quot;Miracle&quot; cast is headed up by Tom Minion, a recent SALT Award winner for Best Actor. Minion&#x27;s focus, subtlety, and deep engagement with the role of Kris Kringle equals the fervor he brought to his award-winning portrayal of Richard Nixon in CNYP&#x27;s &quot;Frost/Nixon.&quot; His performance -- not to mention his own-grown beard and long white hair -- is the rising tide that lifts all boats.",

      "full": "VERONA, N.Y. - John Legend, the modern day king of the soul love ballad, serenaded the near-5,000-seat-capacity crowd with a silky-smooth blend of romance and Christmas cheer. But he wasn&#x27;t the most romantic thing in the Turning Stone Event Center Friday night. That title goes to the man who proposed to his girlfriend while Legend sang &quot;Ordinary People.&quot; Her excited shrieks would have been disconcerting had the flash from the waiting photographers not provided enough light for the crowd to see what was going on and offer a hearty round of applause. Don&#x27;t worry, she said yes. The newly-engaged couple stood in the aisle and slow-danced the rest of that song and the next, the more idealistic &quot;You & I (Nobody in the World),&quot; which Legend sung as home videos of Legend, his wife, the cooking entrepreneur, model and social media superstar Chrissy Teigen, and their two kids played behind him. It&#x27;s easy to just sing about love--well, easy if you have a voice like John Legend, one of only 15 people to ever win an Emmy, Tony, Oscar and a Grammy--but he goes above and beyond in making the audiences feel the emotion he pours into his music. Before singing &quot;Slow Dance,&quot; Legend encouraged the crowd to fill the aisles and do just that. But he had no one to slow dance with, so he invited one lucky woman on stage to dance with him. It took her a minute to work through the stage freight and put her arm around Legend&#x27;s waist, but she eventually did, fulfilling a fantasy surely shared by many in attendance. Toward the end of the song, Legend dropped to a knee, grabbed her hand, looked her in the eyes and sung to her. That stage fright kicked back in, but can you blame her? Jenna, you were a good sport. &quot;My shows are known to be aphrodisiacs,&quot; he said with a sly chuckle, because he knows it&#x27;s true. The show was part of the accompanying tour for his Christmas album, &quot;A Legendary Christmas,&quot; which debuted in late October. But even the Christmas music, especially the original songs, weren&#x27;t immune from Legend&#x27;s signature romantic touch. The stage&#x27;s backdrop transitioned to &quot;JL&#x27;s Juke Joint&quot; for &quot;Merry Christmas Baby,&quot; a bluesy number that had Legend loosening his slim neck tie and hitting low notes with a throaty howl that you don&#x27;t often hear from him. Fellow originals &quot;Wrap Me Up In Your Love&quot; and &quot;No Place Like Home,&quot; which Legend performed while sitting at the piano while donning a velvet smoker&#x27;s jacket--Legend&#x27;s wardrobe choices throughout the evening were as sharp as his voice--were upbeat R&B tunes that would be great any day of the year.",

      "full": "For the first holiday show in its new digs, Redhouse unwraps a sweet adaptation of the beloved &quot;A Charlie Brown Christmas.&quot; Like the best Christmas mornings, it&#x27;s a delight for little ones, sweet nostalgia for the rest of us. The stage &quot;A Charlie Brown Christmas&quot; is closely adapted from the TV special which has been aired every December since its 1965 debut. Devised by Bill Melendez and Lee Mendelson from Charles Schultz&#x27;s &quot;Peanuts&quot; comic strip characters, the half hour animation featured a gentle but unforgettable jazz score by Vince Guaraldi, which is performed at the Redhouse by a three piece combo seen in silhouette behind a scrim. Charlie Brown and his friends are iconic figures, and, happily, director Jonathan David Martin and his energetic cast get them right. Maxwell Anderson, head shaven to create good old Charlie Brown&#x27;s round dome, is pitch perfect as our hero. Soulful eyes, droopy shoulders, and defeated sighs punctuate his search for the true meaning of Christmas as his friends skate, dance, and make a shambles of rehearsal for a Christmas play. Snoopy steals the scene in the comic strip, the television specials and the popular musical &quot;You&#x27;re a Good Man, Charlie Brown.&quot; Talented mime Mariko Iwasa expands on Snoopy&#x27;s role with classic silent comedy sometimes directly lifted from the source, and sometimes not connected at all to Schultz&#x27;s resourceful and cheeky beagle. Carlin Manzi is a properly brassy Lucy, proclaiming herself Christmas queen and doling out five cents&#x27; worth of psychiatric advice. Rangy Joseph Buck scores as the thumb-sucking blanket addicted, but wise beyond his years Linus. The rest of the &quot;Peanuts&quot; gang are also perfectly cast. Even the childlike dance breaks (choreographed by Stephond Brunson) are right on the button. As enjoyable as it is, the 90-minute &quot;A Charlie Brown Christmas&quot; does feel padded. The show begins with an extended section of carols performed by the company, with Charlie Brown trying to stop a mischievous Snoopy from sabotaging the concert to the joyful squeals from the youngest audience members. There&#x27;s a mini-concert of mime mid-show, and a second round of carols ends the show. None of this bothers the giggling children captivated by Iwasa&#x27;s antics. And, of course, that&#x27;s what the holidays are all about.",

      "full": "When Syracuse temperatures drop to the lowest degree, there are a group of women who wear a dress every day for the entire month of December. And it&#x27;s not a style preference, but instead a social justice symbol. Dressember is a national movement that brings together a community of advocates fighting against human trafficking. Since 2013, the movement has raised more than $5 million worldwide. The idea started in 2013 when founder Blythe Hill challenged herself to wear a dress every day of December. For the following four years, her friends joined and Hill realized this challenge had the potential to be more than a fashion statement. That&#x27;s when she turned Dressember into an international campaign to educate people on global commercial sex trade. More than 30 million people are enslaved worldwide and about 2 million children are being exploited, according to the Dressember website. Local advocate Kendra Anderson of Manlius wants people to be aware of the local numbers as well. &quot;People often think human trafficking is only happening in other countries, but it&#x27;s happening here in the U.S. and also in Onondaga County,&quot; said Anderson, a member of CNY Dressember. &quot;Slavery exists everywhere.&quot; This 31-day style challenge that Hill created years ago has gained traction in the Syracuse area. To join, people can pledge to wear a dress or tie every day in December by making a campaign page. They&#x27;ll then use their attire as a conversation starter to teach others about human trafficking statistics. In 2016, Anderson&#x27;s brother - who stands 6-foot-5-inches tall - joined in, walking through Wegmans and visiting coffee shops holding a sign that read, &quot;Ask me why I am wearing a dress.&quot; &quot;It&#x27;s not just about the clothing but it&#x27;s the opportunity we have to teach people about a very serious issue,&quot; Anderson said. Local organizations have gotten involved as well. The McMahon/Ryan Child Advocacy Center became a grant partner last year, helping CNY Dressember raise over $25,000.  Fundraisers and conversations are planned this month at the DeWitt Wegmans and Panera in Fayetteville. People can get involved with Dressember without having to wear a dress or become an advocate. A $20 donation can pay for a survivor&#x27;s aftercare kit. A $105 donation can pay for trial fees that help survivors testify in court. And a $150 donation can pay for training and educators to raise awareness. The Dressember website also has fundraising suggestions, such as planning a benefit sports game, accepting community challenges or hosting a night of live music.",

The Clash railed about geopolitics. Shelley, however, belted out anthems of frustrated love and romance with titles like, &quot;What Do I Get?&quot; and &quot;Ever Fallen in Love.&quot; The music was also anchored in catchy melodies that were directly influenced by the Beatles.

They&#x27;re the containers, typically half-gallon glass jugs, that you fill with draft beer to take home from your local brewery or bar. They&#x27;ve been around for more than a century. Legend has it that 100 years ago they were galvanized steel pails, or buckets, often carried by kids, who were sent by their dads to fetch some beer from the local tavern. (The hissing sound from beer sloshing in the pails reportedly spawned the name &#x27;growler.&#x27;) The boom in craft beer in the past few decades generated a boom in growlers, most often screw-top jugs used to buy draft beer at small breweries that have limited distribution. More recently, growler fills have become common at convenience stores and many other outlets.

      "full": "SYRACUSE, NY -- The co-grand marshals of the 2019 Syracuse St. Patrick&#x27;s Parade have political -- and personal -- ties. Bernie Mahoney, former state Assemblyman and Syracuse city councilor, will join his daughter, Joanie, the former Onondaga County executive, in leading the 37th edition of the annual downtown parade. The 2019 parade is Saturday, March 16, the day before St. Patrick&#x27;s Day itself (last year it was on March 17). At the grand marshal introduction  ceremony today at Kitty Hoynes Irish Pub & Restaurant in Armory Square, the parade committee also introduced its 2019 Gael of the Year. That honor, given for community service, goes this year to Casey Vanderstouw, band director at Baldwinsville Central School District. The Baldswinville Bees are a perennial local high school band powerhouse. The Mahoneys&#x27; selection as grand marshals, parade committee president Janet Higgins said, fits the theme for the 2019 parade: &quot;Syracuse. Irish. Family.&quot; The Mahoney clan emigrated from Ireland&#x27;s County Kerry in the 1800s -- five generations ago. &quot;This year, we&#x27;re celebrating people who have pride in Syracuse, their families, and in their cultural heritage, and the Mahoneys certainly fit the bill,&quot; Higgins said. Bernie Mahoney, noting the presence of his wife, children and grandchildren at the announcement ceremony -- and the &quot;family&quot; theme for the 2019 parade -- said &quot;we are especially pleased to receive that honor.&quot; Joanie Mahoney served 11 years as county executive before stepping down earlier this fall. She now serves as chief operating officer at the State University of New York College of Environmental Science and Forestry and as a special assistant at SUNY Upstate Medical University. As always, the 2019 St. Patrick&#x27;s parade starts at noon at Clinton Square and heads down South Salina Street (aka Nancy Duffy Lane) to West Onondaga Street. It kicks off a day (and in this case weekend) of Irish-themed festivities. More information on the parade. Other St. Patrick&#x27;s Parade news: -- For the 12th year, the parade committee will also sponsor the St. Patrick Hunger Project, which raises funds and collects food for local food pantries. To date, the Hunger Project has provided over 650,000 meals for children and families in the community.

      "full": "SYRACUSE, NY -- Congress Beer, the traditional Syracuse lager that re-launched this summer, is now back in cans. It&#x27;s the first time the beer has been canned since the 1960s, when the Haberle Congress brewery on Syracuse&#x27;s North Side closed. The beer has been available in draft only since it was re-introduced this summer by Willow Rock Brewing Co. of Syracuse in partnership with the Onondaga Historical Association. &quot;Cans were the most iconic package for Congress and we&#x27;re excited to bring them back,&quot; said Rockney Roberts, co-owner at Willow Rock. Can of Congress will go on sale this weekend at the Willow Rock brewery, at 115 Game Road (that&#x27;s behind Danzer&#x27;s restaurant on Ainsley Drive). Four-packs of 16-ounce cans sell for $9.99. The launch begins at noon Saturday. There are also special deals on Congress swag during launch weekend, including a Congress Holiday Gift Pack, which is a four pack of Congress cans, a Congress pilsner glass and a coaster, for $15. That will be available through the holidays. After this weekend, Congress in cans will be found in selected local retailers and bars while supplies last, Roberts said. Branching Out, a bottle shop in Camillus&#x27; Township 5, will be one outlet, with more to come. Willow Rock plans to begin production of Congress and its own beer lineup on its new, expanded brewing system in the near future, Roberts said. From the 1890s to the the early 1960s, Congress was the most popular &quot;hometown&quot; beer in Syracuse, brewed by the Haberle brewery at the corner of Butternut and North McBride streets. The brewery closed in 1962. In its day, it was the Syracuse equivalent to Genesee in Rochester and Utica Club in Utica. The modern re-launch of Congress Beer is spearheaded by the OHA,  which acquired the trademark rights to sell Congress Beer merchandise several years ago. Last year, it secured the rights to brew a beer under the Congress Beer name as a way to raise money for its operations. The OHA tapped Willow Rock, a small craft brewer located between Syracuse&#x27;s University&#x27;s South Campus and Brighton Avenue, to recreate Congress. Roberts and co-owner Kevin Williams used a set of notes on the recipe and procedures donated to the historic association by the last Haberle brewmaster when the brewery closed in 1962. It was Williams&#x27; and Roberts&#x27; challenge to recreate a beer that they could produce in a modern craft brewery but that would also honor the tradition of a light colored, light-bodied &quot;pre craft beer&quot; lager. The beer they came up with is a relatively low alcohol beer, at 4.8 percent, that they describe as &quot;approachable,&quot; &quot;easy drinking,&quot; &quot;light-bodied and crisp&quot; and an &quot;everyday&quot; beer.",

The animated sequel to “Wreck-it-Ralph” generated $25.8 million, according to box office estimates Sunday. That was shy of the $28 million estimated by Box Office Pro analysts. The movie still has a ways to go before it will make back its budget. “Ralph Breaks the Internet” cost $175 million to produce -- before marketing costs -- according to Box Office Mojo. The movie opened in the U.K. this weekend and will continue its global rollout later this month and into next year. The only new wide release of the weekend was the Sony Pictures R-rated horror feature “The Possession of Hannah Grace,” which landed in seventh place after collecting $6.5 million. The movie cost $9.5 million before marketing costs, according to Box Office Mojo. It beat a forecast of $3.2 million by Box Office Pro.",

Men were most often the breadwinners and their wives stayed home and raised the children.

Sewing hints. Beauty shortcuts. Fashion shows. These and many more modern miracles loom on the horizon for the busy homemaker with the advent of television,&quot; LaRue wrote. &quot;It&#x27;s pleasant to think,&quot; she continued, &quot;of how television will make like easier for women.&quot; LaRue pictured cooking programs showing hints and techniques right on the screen. (&quot;Imagine watching how to knead dough so the bread will rise!&quot;) She predicted television programs originating from grocery stores, showcasing the best each store had to offer. A woman could finish her grocery list while watching television. Fashion editors would take women on tours of department stores through the television screen and show off the latest fashions. Women who sewed at home could see the latest patterns and trends. (In a later article in the section a writer thought men too would enjoy watching these fashion segments: &quot;Father will see how to tie his tie. He will be able to enjoy fashion shows, so he can expound his opinions on women&#x27;s clothes.&quot;) <i>Post-Standard file photo</i> <b>Syracuse: Capital of Television</b> The arrival of television meant more to Syracuse than just another form of entertainment. With the opening of the new General Electric plant at Electronics Park, Syracuse, the Herald-American said, is &quot;destined to become the television capital of the world.&quot; Out of the more than 7,100 employees at the GE plant, about 3,000 were engaged in TV work in the numerous laboratories and along the production lines in the big transmitter and receiver buildings. About 5,000 television sets a week were produced at the local plant, proudly carrying the G.E. Syracuse label to cities all over the eastern part of the United States. Meanwhile station transmitters and other equipment for new stations in Los Angeles, Miami, Houston, San Francisco and Miami were being manufactured here. Electronics Park was becoming &quot;a mecca&quot; for thousands of people inside the new industry. Dealers and distributors made visits to get first-hand information on production and new designs. Even rival manufacturers sent representatives to discuss mutual problems and look over the new facilities. <i>Copyright 2004 Heritage Microfilm</i> <b>Emerson&#x27;s Complete Instrument</b> As the Christmas season got started, Central New Yorkers interested in a new television for the holidays had plenty of choices.

Emerson&#x27;s Model 585, selling at Edwards Department Store for $495, was one of the more luxurious sets on the market. Promising &quot;Image Perfection&quot; on a big 52-square-inch screen, giving viewers superb day and night reception of all programs. It was billed as an &quot;amazing COMPLETE instrument.&quot;  Besides the TV screen, it featured a super-powered FM and AM Phonoradio with automatic record changer, all built inside a luxurious console. <i>Copyright 2004 Heritage Microfilm</i> <b>GE&#x27;s Daylight Television</b> General Electric bill itself as &quot;First in Radio - now Leader in Television.&quot; GE&#x27;s innovation was called &quot;Daylight  Television,&quot;which the company claimed gave &quot;the brightest, clearest picture under the sun.&quot; &quot;Never until General Electric achieved this revolutionary new picture-brightness could you fully enjoy the clear, definite realism television should bring you!&quot; A table model, with a ten-inch direct view tube, cost $325 at Chappell&#x27;s, while the fancier console version with AM/FM radio and automatic photograph cost $395.95. <i>Copyright 2004 Heritage Microfilm</i> <b>RCA: First in Television</b> RCA Victor proclaimed itself to be the world leader in radio and was now &quot;1st in television.&quot; Its line of televisions for 1949 included a bevy of brand-new features, none of which probably makes any sense today. The new features included: the RCA Victor Multi-Channel Station Selector, Automatic Gain Control, Four Stage I-F Amplifier, Four Tuned Circuits, Shielded Television Chassis, and Fine-Tuning Control, as well as, &quot;many others too numerous to mention.&quot; RCA models included the &quot;Bystander&quot; for $325 and the &quot;Sightseer&quot; which cost $395 but came with its own matching television table. &quot;The Harrison&quot; was RCA&#x27;s most luxurious model. Called &quot;one beautifully designed piece of furniture,&quot; the unit promised &quot;Big and Bright&quot; television pictures, the listening pleasure of radio programs,&quot; and a &quot;fine automatic record changer.&quot; The &quot;Golden Throat&quot; tone system, reproduced television sound, recorded music and radio broadcasts with unbelievable fullness and clarity. Enclosed in a hand-rubbed cabinet, the set starts at $550. <i>Copyright 2004 Heritage Microfilm</i> <b>Motorola: Television&#x27;s Greatest Value</b> Motorola&#x27;s VT71 was one of the better bargains during the 1948 Christmas season. The unit promised clear-as-crystal television action, with smooth-as-silk FM sound, in a handsome furniture-styled cabinet, &quot;hand-rubbed to give extra beauty to your living room.&quot; Available in walnut, mahogany or blonde wood, the TV weighed just 26 ½ pounds, easy enough to carry from room to room. &quot;The simplified controls make it easy to operate...its budget-low price makes it easy to own.&quot;",
