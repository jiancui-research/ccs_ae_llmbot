Now, Jerome Powell’s statement seems to place an emphasis on boosting broad-based and inclusive employment with the idea that a strong labor market may not cause inflation — and to take the foot off the pedal when it comes to the Fed’s current inflation targeting.**************In one of its most conclusive statements, Powell’s speech notes “therefore, following periods when inflation has been running below 2 percent, appropriate monetary policy will likely aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time.”  Given that we have been in a period where measured inflation is much lower, this seems to indicate that loose monetary policy with lower rate interest rate targeting will not only be a short-term norm, but also a more protracted result of this longer-term philosophical shift.**************Inflation has been running at about 2 percent for more than two years now but is still below what many economists see as its natural rate of around or slightly above this level over time: The Federal Reserve would rather have prices rise only moderately so they can push interest rates back down into negative territory in case there are short periods where unemployment rises beyond levels considered optimal by most central banks while also having monetary policy give workers some support against deflationary pressures from lower wages through price increases after all other economic policies might already be �**************327**************0.17297297297297295**************0
