But do&nbsp; Chelsea &nbsp;have a plan?**************Since the new owners entered the building in the summer of 2022, they&rsquo;ve gone from Thomas Tuchel to Graham Potter to Maurizio Pochettino and now Enzo Maresca as manager (with a couple of interims to mix things up, too).&nbsp; In that same period Chelsea have recruited more than &pound;1 billion in playing talent with varying success, yet how all these new players align with the philosophy of those various managers remains to be seen.**************If so, what is it and how can we be sure that they are not just looking to get the best out of their players for one last big pay day at Stamford Bridge this summer. We have been here before with Eden Hazard who was told he could go by his former manager Mauricio Pochettino but still ended up playing in every Premier League game after Thomas Tuchel took over as Blues boss (he has now left too). The club's new owners would love nothing more than another top-six finish**************557**************0.01098901098901099**************0

Southgate spoke before the Serbia game of how Alexander-Arnold&rsquo;s incredible passing range offers England a different dimension, particularly when he gets on the ball in deeper positions.**************His comfort getting forward and drifting wider proved to be a useful distraction for England as they scored their opening goal, with Alexander-Arnold&rsquo;s positioning in the half-space helping to create room for Bukayo Saka to run directly at his left-back and cross for Jude Bellingham to head home.**************The Liverpool man has been used as an attacking full back by Jurgen Klopp at club level but it is his ability to play out wide and get forward that will make him so important for this Three Lions side if they are playing with two central midfielders alongside Declan Rice or another player who can push further upfield than their natural position**************596**************0.0**************0
