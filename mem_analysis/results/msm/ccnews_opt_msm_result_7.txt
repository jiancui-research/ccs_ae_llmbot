But make no mistake: The SEC is no fan of Hurry’s operations and itself has pursued multiple enforcement actions.**************In 2019, for example, a federal judge imposed a $12 million civil penalty on Alpine for “illegal conduct on a massive scale” after finding the SEC had proved at least 2,720 instances in which the firm ignored red flags when filing required “suspicious activity reports.” Finra’s current attempt to shut Alpine down stems from allegations that it stole from its customers in 2019 by charging outrageous fees and making unauthorized trades.**************In the most recent case, a federal judge in New York last month barred him from selling unregistered securities after finding that he had raised more than $100 million for his company while failing to tell investors it would use their money “to conduct business as an online broker-dealer through which customers could trade stocks on its own account or with other brokerage firms but without any control over how those funds were used; [and] was not required by law**************1300**************0.06172839506172839**************0
