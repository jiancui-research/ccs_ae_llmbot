Maupay managed four goals in his first six games that particular campaign.**************This one might be as obvious as, er, Captain Obvious, but finding the right player to hand the armband in the first three weeks of the season makes a massive difference.&nbsp;In the early days of a new year, established stars in established teams against the weaker sides are the only players you should be considering.&nbsp; Over the years, we've suggested handing the armband to Mo Salah for Liverpool's opening trip to Norwich (he scored one and assisted two) or Bruno Fernandes against Leeds, the season that the Portuguese netted a hat-trick (since Marcelo Bielsa's team had the worst expected goals allowed away from home in 2020/21).**************This season, he has not scored since the opening-day win at home to Manchester United and is on a run of just two Premier League appearances this calendar year (and no starts).
