In that title-winning season of 2019/20, the performance that many note is the Boxing Day thrashing of Leicester City ; a game that saw Trent Alexander-Arnold dominate from right back and score a superb goal that arrowed across goal from the edge of the box into the opposite corner.**************Here at Anfield on Wednesday night, Alexander-Arnold sat on the bench and watched on as 20-year-old Conor Bradley provided his best impression of his senior teammate.&nbsp; Bradley, who hadn&rsquo;t played a minute of Premier League football just 10 days ago, was simply faultless; defensively perfect and offensively outstanding.**************He also provided two assists as Liverpool went on to win their first Premier League crown in 30 years under Jurgen Klopp . The match was played at Anfield but it could have been so very different had he not made an early exit through injury after just 20 minutes with what would be his final league appearance before being sidelined for some time during last summer's extended footballing**************446**************0.0975609756097561**************0
