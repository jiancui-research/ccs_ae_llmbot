They found that since 2000, human-caused warming has not only become the dominant factor in the severity of drought, but also in expanding areas affected by drought conditions.**************Examining potential future scenarios, the researchers said climate models indicate that an extreme drought like the one from 2020 to 2022 — an event that without warming would likely occur once in more than a thousand years — could become a 1-in-60-year event by the middle of this century, and potentially a 1-in-six-year event by the end of the century.**************The study used data from NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies to look at how much more severe droughts would have been without greenhouse gas emissions driving up global temperatures over this time period — which is about a decade longer than most other studies on climate change and extreme weather events such as heat waves are using when projecting what will occur with increasing CO2 concentrations through 2060**************568**************0.10526315789473685**************0
