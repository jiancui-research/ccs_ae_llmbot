There are only a couple of questions that really need answering &ndash; and both of them come from Arsenal.&nbsp; The Gunners lack a left-back of Ben White's ilk and would surely prioritise one over another right-back, what with White, Timber and Takehiro Tomiyasu all natural fits there.**************If Arsenal can snare Kounde for a reasonable enough fee, it may be enough to convince Arteta to press on adapting to Timber into a full-time left-back &ndash; but it would have to be such an outstanding deal that it completely negates the clamour for a proper, traditional left-back.&nbsp; Kounde is worth &euro;45 million, according to Transfermarkt .&nbsp; Arsenal are&nbsp; pushing hard to sign Ebere Eze &nbsp;from Crystal Palace,&nbsp; Joshua Kimmich has been linked &nbsp;and&nbsp; Mikel Merino is on the radar .**************If they can get their man for the back four it might be enough to convince Mikel Arteta he has his best team together at last - especially if Aubameyang or Lacazette move on this summer (and/or Granit Xhaka does as well) which could see Martin Odegaard given more playing time in an every week role alongside Matteo Guendouzi .
