<strong class="sub-title"> Results: Our findings indicate that the global level of m<sup>6</sup>A modification in MSL TNBC is downregulated primarily due to the loss of methyltransferase-like 14 (METTL14).**************The diminished m<sup>6</sup>A modification is crucial for the maintenance of TNBC stemness, as it increases the expression of yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1) by blocking YTH domain-containing family protein 2 (YTHDF2)-mediated transcript decay, thereby promoting the activation of Hippo-independent YAP1 signaling.**************Furthermore, we have demonstrated a potential mechanism by which these data are associated with breast cancer stemness. These results were validated using RNA sequencing and protein microarrays on tissue derived from 3T3(M1) human mesenchymal undifferentiated Stem or HMSC .
